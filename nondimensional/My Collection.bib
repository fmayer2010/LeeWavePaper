@article{Wolanski1984a,
abstract = {Rattray Island, northeast Australia, is 1.5 km long, 300 m wide, and lies in well-mixed water approxi- mately 25 m deep. Its long axis is inclined at about 60 {\o} into the direction of the dominant semidiurnal tidal current. The length of the wake in the lee of the island, as documented by aerial photographs and satellite imagery, appears to equal that of the wake behind a flat plate in a two-dimensional flow at a Reynolds number of about 10. However, current metering, drogues measurements, and temperature mapping indicate internal wake velocities much greater than would be consistent with such a simple low Reynolds number model. Further, estimates of the turbulent eddy coefficient suggest an effective Reyn- olds number more in the vicinity of 10 3 . To reconcile these observational differences and to explain the observed upwelling in the core of the wake, an Ekman pumping model is proposed. It is postulated that the Ekman benthic boundary layer driven by rotation in the wake allows the vertical vorticity introduced into the water at the tip of the island at the point of separation, to be negated by the vorticity of opposite sign introduced at the bottom. Further, it is shown that a large fraction of the kinetic energy of the upstream flow facing the island is used to drive the wake eddies, leading to the conclusions that the trapping of water in the lee of islands greatly increases head losses on continental shelves with numerous islands, coral reefs, and rock outcrops},

abstract = {Seamounts are active or extinct undersea volcanoes with heights exceeding similar to 100 m. They represent a small but significant fraction of the volcanic extrusive budget for oceanic seafloor and their distribution gives information about spatial and temporal variations in intraplate volcanic activity. In addition, they sustain important ecological communities, determine habitats for fish, and act as obstacles to Currents, thus enhancing tidal energy dissipation and ocean mixing. Mapping the complete global distribution will help constrain models of seamount formation as well as aid in understanding marine habitats and deep ocean circulation. Two approaches have been used to map the global seamount distribution. Depth soundings from single- and multibeam echosounders can provide the most detailed maps with up to 200-m horizontal resolution. However, soundings from the {\textgreater} 5000 publicly available cruises sample only a small fraction of the ocean floor. Satellite altimetry can detect seamounts taller than similar to 1.5 km, and. studies using altimetry have produced seamount catalogues holding almost 13,000 seamounts. Based on the size-frequency relationship for larger seamounts, we predict over 100,000 seamounts {\textgreater} 1 km in height remain uncharted, and speculatively 25 million {\textgreater} 100 m in height. Future altimetry missions could improve on resolution and significantly decrease noise levels, allowing for an even larger number of intermediate (1-1.5-km height) seamounts to be detected. Recent retracking of the radar altimeter waveforms to improve the accuracy of the gravity field has resulted in a twofold increase in resolution. Thus, improved analyses of existing altimetry with better calibration from multibeam bathymetry could also increase census estimates.},

abstract = {We report evidence of two deep cyclonic and two deep anticyclonic submesoscale eddies from World Oceanographic Circulation Experiment hydrographic casts made in the Brazil Basin. We infer that three were likely formed in or near the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), and thus had traveled eastward after formation. These eddies appear to be a new way for transporting NADW away from the DWBC to the ocean interior. One of the apparent cyclonic eddies appeared to be laterally in contact with one of the anticyclonic eddies. About 10 days later an attempt was made to resample the apparent eddies that had been in contact. These observations, although limited, are interpreted to indicate that they survived the encounter, that the cyclonic eddy had now moved to be beneath the anticyclonic one with each being somewhat thinner, and that they produced a new anticyclonic eddy by partially merging. Deep float observations [Hogg and Owens, 1999] partially support the second inference.},

abstract = {This study reports on observations of turbulent dissipation and internal wave-scale flow properties in a standing meander of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) north of the Kerguelen Plateau. The au- thors characterize the intensity and spatial distribution of the observed turbulent dissipation and the derived turbulent mixing, and consider underpinning mechanisms in the context of the internal wave field and the processes governing the waves' generation and evolution. The turbulent dissipation rate and the derived diapycnal diffusivity are highly variable with systematic depth dependence. The dissipation rate is generally enhanced in the upper 1000–1500 mof the water column, and both the dissipation rate and diapycnal diffusivity are enhanced in some places near the seafloor, com- monly in regions of rough topography and in the vicinity of strong bottom flows associated with theACCjets. Turbulent dissipation is high in regions where internal wave energy is high, consistent with the idea that interior dissipation is related to a breaking internal wave field. Elevated turbulence occurs in association with downward-propagating near-inertial waves within 1–2 km of the surface, as well as with upward-propagating, relatively high-frequency waves within 1–2 km of the seafloor. While an interpretation of these near-bottom waves as lee waves generated byACCjets flowing over small-scale topographic roughness is supported by the qualitative match between the spatial patterns in predicted lee wave radiation and observed near-bottom dissipation, the observed dissipation is found to be only a small percentage of the energy flux predicted by theory. The mismatch suggests an alternative fate to local dissipation for a significant fraction of the radiated energy},

abstract = {The impact of parameterized topographic internal lee wave drag on the input and output terms in the total mechanical energy budget of a hybrid coordinate high-resolution global ocean general circulation model forced by winds and air-sea buoyancy fluxes is examined here. Wave drag, which parameterizes the generation of internal lee waves arising from geostrophic flow impinging upon rough topography, is included in the prognostic model, ensuring that abyssal currents and stratification in the model are affected by the wave drag.An inline mechanical (kinetic plus gravitational potential) energy budget including four dissipative terms (parameterized topographic internal lee wave drag, quadratic bottom boundary layer drag, vertical eddy viscosity, and horizontal eddy viscosity) demonstrates that wave drag dissipates less energy in the model than a diagnostic (offline) estimate would suggest, due to reductions in both the abyssal currents and stratification. The equator experiences the largest reduction in energy dissipation associated with wave drag in inline versus offline estimates. Quadratic bottom drag is the energy sink most affected globally by the presence of wave drag in the model; other energy sinks are substantially affected locally, but not in their global integrals. It is suggested that wave drag cannot be mimicked by artificially increasing the quadratic bottom drag because the energy dissipation rates associated with bottom drag are not spatially correlated with those associated with wave drag where the latter are small. Additionally, in contrast to bottom drag, wave drag is a non-local energy sink.All four aforementioned dissipative terms contribute substantially to the total energy dissipation rate of about one terawatt. The partial time derivative of potential energy (non-zero since the isopycnal depths have a long adjustment time), the surface advective fluxes of potential energy, the rate of change of potential energy due to diffusive mass fluxes, and the conversion between internal energy and potential energy also play a non-negligible role in the total mechanical energy budget. Reasons for the {\textless}10{\%} total mechanical energy budget imbalance are discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper proposes and discusses mechanisms whereby mean flows and jets are produced by differential rotation and by topographic effects. It is shown that, in general, a mean gradient of potential vorticity not only inhibits the cascade of energy to large scales but directly produces anisotropic structures. Scalings for this are examined on the $\beta$ plane using ideas from classical phenomenology. The scalings are naturally anisotropic and predict the formation of zonal flows directly through a turbulent cascade. Numerical simulations and two-point closure calculations qualitatively confirm the predictions. Also, simulations of barotropic flow on the $\beta$ plane can produce zonal jet structures of exceptional persistence over many eddy turnover times. Unsteady flow over topography generally produces a mean flow with a correlation between streamfunction and topography, with anticyclonic motion over humps.

abstract = {The impact of topographic internal lee wave drag (wave drag hereafter) on several aspects of the low-frequency circulation in a high-resolution global ocean model forced by winds and air-sea buoyancy fluxes is examined here. The HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) is run at two different horizontal resolutions (one nominally 1/12° and the other 1/25°). Wave drag, which parameterizes both topographic blocking and the generation of lee waves arising from geostrophic flow impinging upon rough topography, is inserted into the simulations as they run. The parameterization used here affects the momentum equations and hence the structure of eddy kinetic energy. Lee waves also have implications for diapycnal mixing in the ocean, though the parameterization does not directly modify the density. Total near-bottom energy dissipation due to wave drag and quadratic bottom boundary layer drag is nearly doubled, and the energy dissipation due to quadratic bottom drag is reduced by about a factor of two, in simulations with an inserted wave drag compared to simulations having only quadratic bottom drag. With the insertion of wave drag, the kinetic energy is reduced in the abyss and in a three-dimensional global integral. Deflection by partial topographic blocking is inferred to be one reason why the near-bottom kinetic energy can increase in locations where there is little change in dissipation by quadratic bottom drag. Despite large changes seen in the abyss, the changes that occur near the sea surface are relatively small upon insertion of wave drag into the simulations. Both the sea surface height variance and geostrophic surface kinetic energy are reduced on global average by more than twice the seasonal variability in these diagnostics. Alterations in the intensified jet positions brought about by inserting wave drag are not distinguishable from the temporal variability of jet positions. Various statistical measures suggest that applying wave drag only within a fixed distance from the seafloor is not detrimental to the model performance relative to observations. However, the introduction of a novel diagnostic suggests that one way to improve the wave drag parameterization is to allow the vertical deposition of lee wave momentum flux to be spatially heterogeneous.},

abstract = {Abstract The alongslope currents flowing over topography of sufficiently length scale, typically less than 10 km, on the continental slopes generate internal lee waves. These carry their momentum predominently toward shallower water, that is up the slope toward and across the shelf break, and onto the continental shelf, at least when, in summer, stratification permits their propagation. Analytical results show that even when the lee waves are generated with a component of their group velocity directed toward deeper water, reflection at the sloping seabed may lead to a turning toward shallower water. A numerical model is used to examine internal wave propagation and to quantify the flux of their momentum across the shelf break. In the conditions consiidered here with f/N?1 and slope angle, $\alpha$ a, near 5 deg, the flux is parameterized by a stress (momentum flux per unit vertical area along the shelf break) per unit length downslope,.$\tau$*, given by $\tau$* = k?0VNh2 cos4(? + ?0), where po is the mean water density, V is the mean alongslope flow over the slope,N is the buoyancy frequency in the vicinity of the shelf break, f is the Coriolis parameter, and h2? and, ? are the mean square amplitude of the topography of wavenumber l, such that VIIN ? 1, and its mean orientation relative to the upslope direction, respectively. The constant ? O is 7 ±2 deg, and the formula is only valid if ? {\textless}60 deg. A value of k of about 9 (±4) ? 10?6 m?2 suggested, with values new 1.3 ? 10 ?5 m ?2? when the topography is dominated by wavelengths less than 47$\pi$VIN, or 5 ? 10 ?6 m ?2? when they exceed 2OVIN. This flux represents a transfer of momentum to the shelf currents in a direction contrary to the current over the slope that generates the internal waves. The magnitude of the flux is usually dominated by conditions near the top of the continental slope. Timescales of about 5 days are associated with this transfer on 5 deg slopes with 10?m high topography when N≈10 ?2 s ?1},

abstract = {Satellite altimetry and high-resolution ocean models indicate that the Southern Ocean comprises an in- tricate web of narrow, meandering jets that undergo spontaneous formation, merger, and splitting events, as well as rapid latitude shifts over periods of weeks to months. The role of topography in controlling jet vari- ability is explored using over 100 simulations from a doubly periodic, forced-dissipative, two-layer quasi- geostrophic model. The system is forced by a baroclinically unstable, vertically sheared mean flow in a domain that is large enough to accommodate multiple jets. The dependence of (i) meridional jet spacing, (ii) jet variability, and (iii) domain-averaged meridional transport on changes in the length scale and steepness of simple sinusoidal topographical features is analyzed. The Rhines scale, b 5 2p p Ve/b vorticity gradient, measures the meridional extent of eddy mixing by a single jet. The ratio b/T, where T is the topographic length scale, governs jet behavior. Multiple, steady jets with fixed meridional spacing are observed when bT or when b T. When b , T, a pattern of perpetual jet formation and jet merger dominates the time evolution of the system. Zonal ridges systematically reduce the domain-averaged me- ridional transport, while two-dimensional, sinusoidal bumps can increase transport by an order of magnitude or more. For certain parameters, bumpy topography gives rise to periodic oscillations in the jet structure between purely zonal and topographically steered states. In these cases, transport is dominated by bursts of mixing associated with the transition between the two regimes. Topography modifies local potential vorticity (PV) gradients and mean flows; this can generate asymmetric Reynolds stresses about the jet core and can feed back on the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy through baroclinic instability. Both pro- cesses contribute to unsteady jet behavior. It is likely that these processes play a role in the dynamic nature of Southern Ocean jets. , where Ve is an eddy velocity scale and b is the barotropic potential 1.

abstract = {A patch of sulfur hexafluoride was released in May 1992 in the eastern North Atlantic on an isopycnal surface near 300 m depth and was surveyed over a period of 30 months as it dispersed across and along isopycnal surfaces. The diapycnal eddy diffusivity K estimated for the first 6 months was 0.12 + 0.02 cmZ/s, while for the subsequent 24 months it was 0.17 + 0.02 cm2/s. The vertical tracer distribution remained very close to Gaussian for the full 30 months, as the root mean square (rms) dispersion grew from 5 to 50 m. Lateral dispersion was measured on several scales. The growth of the rms width of the tracer streaks from less than 100 m to approximately 300 m within 2 weeks implies an isopycnal diffusivity of 0.07 m2/s at scales of 0.1 to i km, larger than expected from the interaction between vertical shear of the internal waves and diapycnal mixing. Teasing of the overall patch, initially about 25 km across, into streaks with an overall length of 1800 km within 6 months supports predictions of exponential growth by the mesoscale strain field at a rate of 3 + 0.5 x 10 -7 s -1. The rms width of these streaks, estimated as 3 km and maintained in the face of the streak growth, indicates an isopycnal diffusivity of 2 m2/s at scales of i to 10 km, much greater than expected from internal wave shear dispersion. The patch was painted in, albeit streakily, by 12 months, confirming expectations from analytical and numerical models. Homogenization of the patch continued during the subsequent 18 months, while the patch continued to spread with an effective isopycnal eddy diffusivity on the order of 1000 m2/s, acting at scales of 30 to 300 km. 1.},

abstract = {Internal tide generation is examined for a knife-edge ridge and an abrupt step. The energy flux from a knife-edge ridge with a height much less than the water depth is shown to be twice that from a Witch of Agnesi ridge with the same height but a small slope. In contrast, the energy flux from an abrupt step with an infinitesimal depth change compared to the water depth is the same as from a small slope with the same depth change. For larger topographic heights in both cases, the energy flux from the abrupt topography can significantly exceed that from gentle topography. The energy flux generated at a top-hat ridge and top-hat trench is also calculated. A top-hat ridge generates more energy flux than a knife edge of equivalent height, though the increase is large only for ridges whose height is small compared to the total depth. Additionally, the energy flux produced by a top-hat ridge is found to be rather insensitive to the ridge width. In contrast, the energy flux generated at a top-hat trench is strongly dependent on width. A knife-edge ridge of moderate height has much of its energy flux in mode 1. For a height to depth ratio comparable to that of the Hawaiian Ridge this fraction is 75{\%}, consistent with observations. We also show that energy flux estimates based on representing general topography as a number of independent steps are flawed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Observations of turbulent dissipation above rough bathymetry in the abyssal Brazil Basin are presented. Relative to regions with smooth bathymetry, dissipation is markedly enhanced above rough topography of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with levels above bathymetric slopes exceeding levels observed over crests and canyon floors. Furthermore, mixing levels in rough areas are modulated by the spring-neap tidal cycle. Internal waves generated by barotropic tidal flow over topography are the likely mechanism for supplying the energy needed to support the observed turbulent dissipation. A model of the spatial and temporal patterns in the turbulent dissipation rate is used to constrain the diapycnal advection in an inverse calculation for the circulation in an area of rough bathymetry. This inverse model uses both beta-spiral and integrated forms of the advective budgets for heat, mass, and vorticity, and contains sufficient information to resolve the full three-dimensional flow. The inverse model solution reveals the presence of a bouyancy forced circulation driven by mixing in abyssal canyons. On isopycnals above the level of fracture-zone crests near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the flow is westward and fluid is downwelled toward greater density. Along deeper isopycnals, fluid is carried eastward and upwelled in canyons. The divergence of diapycnal mass flux is a significant forcing mechanism for this circulation. These results suggest that mixing in abyssal canyons plays an important role in the circulation of abyssal waters.},

abstract = {[1] A primitive equation model is used to examine the structure and energetics of M-2 internal tides generated at the Hawaiian Ridge. Recent estimates based on altimeter data suggest that 20 GW of barotropic tidal dissipation occurs at the ridge, with conversion to internal tides believed to be the dominant dissipation mechanism. The model simulates an internal tide that accounts for 9.7 GW of radiated energy away from the ridge in the northeast and southwest directions. The strongest generation occurs at three sites where enhanced barotropic currents flow across elongated topographic features. The depth-integrated baroclinic energy flux and energy densities at these sites are on the order of 10(4) W m(-1) and 10(4) J m(-2), respectively. A modal decomposition indicates that 62{\%} of the outgoing energy flux is accounted for by the first internal mode, 15{\%} is accounted for by the second mode, and less than 5{\%} is accounted for by each subsequent higher mode. The tidal dissipation due to bottom friction along the ridge is estimated to be 0.1 GW. The level of turbulent dissipation near the ridge owing to tidal energy conversion remains to be determined to assess fully the barotropic-baroclinic energy budget.},

The bottom stratification and geostrophic velocity fields needed for the calculation of the energy flux into lee waves are provided by Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory?s global coupled ocean?ice?atmosphere model, CM2G. The unresolved mesoscale eddy energy is parameterized as a function of the large-scale available potential energy. Simulations using historical and representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios were performed over the 1861?2200 period. The diagnostics herein suggest a decrease of the global energy flux into lee waves on the order of 20{\%} from preindustrial to future climate conditions under the RCP8.5 scenario. In the Southern Ocean, the energy flux into lee waves exhibits a clear annual cycle with maximum values in austral winter. The long-term decrease of the global energy flux into lee waves and the annual cycle of the energy flux in the Southern Ocean are mostly due to changes in bottom velocity.},

The breaking of internal tides is a major source of diapycnal mixing. Many recent climate models parameterize internal-tide breaking using the scheme of St Laurent et al. (2002). While this parameterization dynamically accounts for internal-tide generation, the vertical distribution of the resultant mixing is ad hoc, prescribing energy dissipation to decay exponentially above the ocean bottom with a fixed length scale. Recently, Polzin (2009) formulated a dynamically based parameterization, in which the vertical profile of dissipation decays algebraically with a varying decay scale, accounting for variable stratification using WKB stretching. We compare two simulations using the St Laurent and Polzin formulations in the CM2G ocean-ice-atmosphere coupled model, with the same formulation for internal-tide energy input.

abstract = {The weakly nonlinear, two-dimensional problem for the disturbance due to a slender obstacle in a uniformly stratified, Boussinesq fluid moving past the obstacle with constant basic horizontal velocity U, is considered up to second order in the amplitude $\epsilon$ of the disturbance. Analogous rotating problems are also treated. Particular attention is given to calculating explicitly the columnar-disturbance strengths upstream and downstream of the obstacle, both in the stratified and in the rotating problems, with a view to discussing the truth or otherwise of Long's hypothesis (LH). Whether or not columnar disturbances are found far upstream, violating LH, depends, interalia, on whether or not the flow is externally bounded by rigid horizontal planes (or by a tube or annulus, in the rotating problem), and on whether the problem is made determinate by means of an ‘inviscid transient' formulation, or by means of a ‘viscous' one. The inviscid, transient, bounded problem, for time-development of lee waves from a state of no initial disturbance, always exhibits columnar disturbances oforder $\epsilon$2 somewhere in the fluid. They are generated, not near the obstacle, but in the ‘tails' or transient terminal zones of the lee-wave trains. The columnar-disturbance strengths are largely independent of how the flow is set up from an initially undisturbed state. I n all but one instance the effect is non-zero far up-stream. The exception is the singly-subcritical stratified (or narrow-gap rotating) case, in which the excitation has modal structure sin(2z), the fluid region being 0 [less-than-or-eq, slant] z [less-than-or-eq, slant] $\pi$ in this case the only columnar disturbance that can penetrate up-stream has structure sinz and so is not excited. A completely different result holds for ‘viscous' formulations for unseparated, bounded r{\'{e}}gimes (with steady lee waves spatially attenuated by effects of small molecular diffusion). The strengths of all columnar disturbances, upstream and downstream, vanish in the limit of small diffusivity. In the inviscid, transient, unbounded problem, the upstream influence is, likewise, evanescent, being O($\epsilon$2t−2) as time t [rightward arrow] [infty infinity].},

abstract = {Observational and model estimates of the form drag on Three Tree Point, a headland located in a tidal channel of Puget Sound, Washington, are presented. Subsurface, Three Tree Point is a sloping ridge. Tidal flow over this ridge gives rise to internal lee waves that lead to wave drag and enhanced mixing. At the same time, horizontal flow separation produces a headland eddy that distorts the surface height field in the lee of the point. Two observational methods for estimating the portion of the form drag associated with deformation of the surface height field, referred to here as the "external" form drag, are also introduced. Drogued drifters and ship-mounted acoustic current profiles from different days are used to indirectly map the flood-tide surface height field. Data are derived from a depth shallow enough that baroclinic pressure gradient forcing may be neglected, and yet deep enough that wind stress may also be ignored. This leaves an approximate balance between the acceleration and surface height pressure gradient, permitting, in this case, two independent estimates of the surface height (to within a constant). These fields are used to calculate the external form drag at the headland. Drag estimates from both observational datasets agree well. External form drag decreases offshore of the headland as expected, and is highly dependent on tidal phase, with maximum drag leading peak flood currents by 1-2 h at this location. Form drag is much larger than model estimates of the frictional drag, implying that it is the dominant mechanism extracting energy from the barotropic tide. A kinematic argument is also presented to show why the external form drag should increase in importance relative to the frictional drag as the topographic slope and tidal excursion increase.},

abstract = {Oceanic density overturns are commonly used to parameterize the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy. This method assumes a linear scaling between the Thorpe length scale LT and the Ozmidov length scale LO. Historic evidence supporting LT ; LO has been shown for relatively weak shear-driven turbulence of the thermocline; however, little support for the method exists in regions of turbulence driven by the convective collapse of topographically influenced overturns that are large by open-ocean standards. This study presents a direct comparison of LT and LO, using vertical profiles of temperature and microstructure shear collected in the Luzon Strait—a site characterized by topographically influenced overturns up to O(100) m in scale. The comparison is also done for open-ocean sites in the Brazil basin and North Atlantic where overturns are generally smaller and due to different processes. A key result is that LT/LO increases with overturn size in a fashion similar to that observed in numerical studies of Kelvin–Helmholtz (K–H) instabilities for all sites but is most clear in data from the Luzon Strait. Resultant bias in parameterized dissipation is mitigated by ensemble averaging; however, a positive bias appears when instantaneous observations are depth and time integrated. For a series of profiles taken during a spring tidal period in the Luzon Strait, the integrated value is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that based on the microstructure observations. Physical arguments supporting LT ; LO are revisited, and conceptual regimes explaining the relationship between LT/LO and a nondimensional overturn size L c T are proposed.

We consider a steady barotropic current impinging on an obstacle in a rotating and linearly stratified environment. The obstacle is a triangular prism and represents an idealized headland extending from the coast. Numerical experiments are conducted at constant Rossby number Ro = 0.06, varying the Burger number, Bu, and the obstacle slope, ??. Flow regime diagrams in the Bu-?? space are determined. For Bu {\textless} 0.1, vertical movement over the obstacle is enhanced and a fully attached regime with pronounced internal waves is established. For 0.1 ??? Bu {\textless} 1, fluid parcels flow more around the obstacle than over it. Flow separation occurs and small tip eddies start to shed. For Bu ??? 1, tip eddies merge to form larger eddies in the lee of the cape. We find that previous laboratory results cannot be used for gentler slopes, since bottom flow regimes are strongly dependent on ?? when Bu ??? 1. The form drag coefficient exerted by the cape is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the one due to skin friction. It increases with increasing Burger numbers and decreasing slopes. When no separation occurs (low Bu), the increase with decreasing slopes is the result of the mixing associated with hydraulic phenomena. For intermediate and high Bu, form drag coefficients reach larger values as a result of the boundary layer mixing associated with flow separation. We put forth an empirical parametrization of form drag in the Bu-?? space. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The slow-flow case gives rise to a large region of horizontal (isopycnal) flow separation with proportionally stronger relative vorticity in the wake than the wave-generating case. Pressure drag coefficients based on projected frontal area are similar for both cases, increase linearly with the corrugation amplitude, and level off around a value of 1?1.2.},

abstract = {The global distribution and 54-year time dependence of the energy-flux from the wind to near-inertial motions is computed by driving a slab mixed-layer model with NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis winds, improving upon previous estimates [Alford, 2001; Watanabe and Hibiya, 2002]. The slab model is solved spectrally with frequency-dependent damping. The resulting solutions are more physically sensible than the previous, and more skillful at high latitudes, where the inertial frequency approaches the 4×-daily sampling of the Reanalysis winds. This enables Alford's calculation, whose domain was limited to ±50°, to be extended to the poles. The high-latitude reliability is demonstrated by direct comparison with a high-resolution regional model (REMO) in the NE Atlantic. The total power input, 0.47 TW, has increased by 25{\%} since 1948, paralleling observed increases in extratropical cyclone frequency and intensity. If believable, the trend may have important consequences for modulation of the meridional overturning circulation.},

abstract = {Internal gravity waves, the subsurface analogue of the familiar surface gravity waves that break on beaches, are ubiquitous in the ocean. Because of their strong vertical and horizontal currents, and the turbulent mixing caused by their breaking, they affect a panoply of ocean processes, such as the supply of nutrients for photosynthesis, sediment and pollutant transport and acoustic transmission; they also pose hazards for man-made structures in the ocean. Generated primarily by the wind and the tides, internal waves can travel thousands of kilometres from their sources before breaking, making it challenging to observe them and to include them in numerical climate models, which are sensitive to their effects. For over a decade, studies have targeted the South China Sea, where the oceans' most powerful known internal waves are generated in the Luzon Strait and steepen dramatically as they propagate west. Confusion has persisted regarding their mechanism of generation, variability and energy budget, however, owing to the lack of in situ data from the Luzon Strait, where extreme flow conditions make measurements difficult. Here we use new observations and numerical models to (1) show that the waves begin as sinusoidal disturbances rather than arising from sharp hydraulic phenomena, (2) reveal the existence of {\textgreater}200-metre-high breaking internal waves in the region of generation that give rise to turbulence levels {\textgreater}10,000 times that in the open ocean, (3) determine that the Kuroshio western boundary current noticeably refracts the internal wave field emanating from the Luzon Strait, and (4) demonstrate a factor-of-two agreement between modelled and observed energy fluxes, which allows us to produce an observationally supported energy budget of the region. Together, these findings give a cradle-to-grave picture of internal waves on a basin scale, which will support further improvements of their representation in numerical climate predictions.},

abstract = {Advances in computing are enabling atmospheric models to operate at increasingly fine resolution, giving rise to more variations in the underlying orography being captured by the model grid. Consequently, high-resolution models must overcome the problems associated with traditional terrain-following approaches of spurious winds and instabilities generated in the vicinity of steep and complex terrain. Cut-cell representations of orography present atmospheric models with an alternative to terrain-following vertical coordinates. This work explores the capabilities of a cut-cell representation of orography for idealized orographically forced flows. The orographic surface is represented within the model by continuous piecewise bilinear surfaces that intersect the regular Cartesian grid creating cut cells. An approximate finite-volume method for use with advection-form governing equations is implemented to solve flows through the resulting irregularly shaped grid boxes. Comparison with a benchmark orographic test case for nonhydrostatic flow shows very good results. Further tests demonstrate the cut-cell method for flow around 3D isolated hills and stably resolving flows over very steep orography.},

The physical setting of Galveston Bay is described by synthesis of long-term observations. Several processes in addition to tidal hydrodynamics and baroclinic circulation processes contribute substantially to the observed variability of currents, water level and salinity. The model was therefore forced with realistic water levels, river discharges, winds, coastal buoyancy currents (due to the Mississippi River plume) and surface heat fluxes. Quantitative metrics were used to evaluate model performance against observations and both spatial and temporal variability in tidal and sub-tidal hydrodynamics were generally well represented by the model. Three different unstructured meshes were tested, a triangular mesh that under-resolved the shipping channel, a triangular mesh that resolved it, and a mixed quadrilateral-triangular grid with approximately equivalent resolution. It is shown that salinity and sub-tidal velocity are better predicted when the important topographic features, such as the shipping channel, are resolved. It was necessary to increase the seabed drag roughness in the mixed quadrilateral-triangular grid simulation to attain similar performance to the equivalent triangular mesh.},

abstract = {Abstract Observations and inverse models suggest that small-scale turbulent mixing is enhanced in the Southern Ocean in regions above rough topography. The enhancement extends O(1) km above the topography, suggesting that mixing is supported by the breaking of gravity waves radiated from the ocean bottom. In this study, it is shown that the observed mixing rates can be sustained by internal waves generated by geostrophic motions flowing over bottom topography. Weakly nonlinear theory is used to describe the internal wave generation and the feedback of the waves on the zonally averaged flow. Vigorous inertial oscillations are driven at the ocean bottom by waves generated at steep topography. The wave radiation and dissipation at equilibrium is therefore the result of both geostrophic flow and inertial oscillations differing substantially from the classical lee-wave problem. The theoretical predictions are tested versus two-dimensional high-resolution numerical simulations with parameters representative of Drake Passage. This work suggests that mixing in Drake Passage can be supported by geostrophic motions impinging on rough topography rather than by barotropic tidal motions, as is commonly assumed.},

abstract = {Recent observations from the Hawaiian Ridge indicate episodes of overturning and strong dissipation coupled with the tidal cycle near the top of the ridge. Simulations with realistic topography and stratification suggest that this overturning has its origins in transient internal hydraulic jumps that occur below the shelf break at maximum ebb tide, and then propagate up the slope as internal bores when the flow reverses. A series of numerical simulations explores the parameter space of topographic slope, barotropic velocity, stratification, and forcing frequency to identify the parameter regime in which these internal jumps are possible. Theoretical analysis predicts that the tidally driven jumps may occur when the vertical tidal excursion is large, which is shown to imply steep topographic slopes, such that dh/dxN/$\omega$ {\textgreater} 1. The vertical length scale of the jumps is predicted to depend on the flow speed such that the jump Froude number is of order unity. The numerical results agree with the theoretical predictions, with finite-amplitude internal hydraulic jumps and overturning forming during strong offslope tidal flow over steep slopes. These results suggest that internal hydraulic jumps may be an important mechanism for local tidally generated mixing at tall steep topography.},

The vortex cannot be explained by Taylor-Proudman dynamics because of its - 0.3fN super(2) negative potential vorticity anomaly. The plus or minus 0.3f fortnightly cycle in the vortex's strength suggests that it is at least partially maintained against dissipative erosion by tidal rectification. The diurnal motions are slightly subinertial, turning clockwise in time and counterclockwise with depth over the summit plain. They also exhibit a fortnightly cycle in their amplitude, pointing to seamount amplification of impinging barotropic tides. Their horizontal structure resembles that of a seamount-trapped topographic wave. However, the counterclockwise turning with depth of the horizontal velocity vector and the 180 degree phase difference between radial velocity u super(') sub(r) and vertical displacement [imgchar=http://ams.allenpress.com.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/charent/greek/unaccented/lowerc a se/xi.gif]' = -T'/T sub(z) (producing a net positive radial heat flux ) are more consistent with a vortex-trapped near-inertial internal wave of upward energy propagation. The strong negative vorticity of the vortex cap allows the diurnal frequency to be effectively superinertial; that is, diurnal fluctuations satisfy a hyperbolic equation within the vortex. A vortex- trapped wave would encounter a vertical critical layer at the top of the cap where its energy would be lost to turbulence. Observed turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates of [imgchar=http://ams.allenpress.com.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/charent/greek/unaccented/lowerc a se/epsiv.gif] = 3 10 super(-8)/W kg super(-1) are sufficiently high to deplete the wave and vortex in less than 3 days, emphasizing the strongly forced/damped nature of the system. Inferred eddy diffusivities two orders of magnitude larger than those found in the ocean interior suggest that, locally, seamounts are important sites for diapycnal transport. On basin scales, however, there are too few seamounts or ridges penetrating the main pycnocline to support a basin-averaged diffusivity of O(10 super(-4) m super(2) s super(-1) above 3000-m depth.},

abstract = {AbstractDirect observations in the Southern Ocean report enhanced internal wave activity and turbulence in a kilometer-thick layer above rough bottom topography collocated with the deep-reaching fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Linear theory, corrected for finite-amplitude topography based on idealized, two-dimensional numerical simulations, has been recently used to estimate the global distribution of internal wave generation by oceanic currents and eddies. The global estimate shows that the topographic wave generation is a significant sink of energy for geostrophic flows and a source of energy for turbulent mixing in the deep ocean. However, comparison with recent observations from the Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean shows that the linear theory predictions and idealized two-dimensional simulations grossly overestimate the observed levels of turbulent energy dissipation. This study presents two- and three-dimensional, realistic topography simulations of internal lee-wave generation from a steady flow interacting with topography with parameters typical of Drake Passage. The results demonstrate that internal wave generation at three-dimensional, finite bottom topography is reduced compared to the two-dimensional case. The reduction is primarily associated with finite-amplitude bottom topography effects that suppress vertical motions and thus reduce the amplitude of the internal waves radiated from topography. The implication of these results for the global lee-wave generation is discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract Fine- and micro-structure observations indicate that turbulent mixing is enhanced within O(1) km above rough topography. Enhanced mixing is associated with internal wave breaking and, in many regions of the ocean, has been linked to the breaking and dissipation of internal tides. The generation and dissipation of internal tides are explored in this study using a high-resolution two-dimensional nonhydrostatic numerical model, which explicitly resolves the instabilities leading to wave breaking, configured in an idealized domain with a realistic multiscale topography and flow characteristics. The control simulation, chosen to represent the Brazil Basin region, produces a vertical profile of energy dissipation and temporal characteristics of finescale motions that are consistent with observations. Results suggest that a significant fraction of mixing in the bottom O(1) km of the ocean is sustained by the transfer of energy from the large-scale internal tides to smaller-scale internal waves by nonlinear wave?wave interactions. The time scale of the energy transfer to the smaller scales is estimated to be on the order of a few days. A suite of sensitivity experiments is carried out to examine the dependence of the energy transfer time scale and energy dissipation on topographic roughness, tidal amplitude, and Coriolis frequency parameters. Implications for tidal mixing parameterizations are discussed.},

abstract = {The impact of small- scale topography on the ocean's dynamical balance is investigated by quantifying the rates at which internal wave drag extracts (angular) momentum and vorticity from the general circulation. The calculation exploits the recent advent of two near- global descriptions of topographic roughness on horizontal scales on the order of 1- 10 km, which play a central role in the generation of internal lee waves by geostrophic flows impinging on topography and have been hitherto unresolved by bathymetric datasets and ocean general circulation models alike. It is found that, while internal wave drag is a minor contributor to the ocean's dynamical balance over much of the globe, it is a significant player in the dynamics of extensive areas of the ocean, most notably the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and several regions of enhanced small- scale topographic variance in the equatorial and Southern Hemisphere oceans. There, the contribution of internal wave drag to the ocean's (angular) momentum and vorticity balances is generally on the order of ten to a few tens of percent of the dominant source and sink terms in each dynamical budget, which are respectively associated with wind forcing and form drag by topography with horizontal scales from 500 to 1000 km. It is thus suggested that the representation of internal wave drag in general circulation models may lead to significant changes in the deep ocean circulation of those regions. A theoretical scaling is derived that captures the basic dependence of internal wave drag on topographic roughness and near- bottom flow speed for most oceanographically relevant regimes.},

abstract = {Topex/Poseidon (T/P) altimetry has reopened the problem of how tidal dissipation is to be allocated. There is now general agreement of a M2 dissipation by 2.5 Terawatts (1 TW - 101 w) based on four quite separate astronomic observational programs. Allowing for the bodily tide dissipation of 0.1 TW leaves 2.4 TW for ocean dissipation. The traditional disposal sites since JEFFREYS (1920) have been in the turbulent bottom boundary layer (BBL) of marginal seas, and the modern estimate of about 2.1 TW is in this tradition (but the distribution among the shallow seas has changed radically from time to time). Independent estimates of energy flux into marginal seas are not in good agreement with the BBL estimates. T/P altimetry has contributed to the tidal problem in two important ways. The assimilation of global altimetry into Laplace tidal solutions has led to accurate representations of the global tides, as evidenced by the very close agreement between the astronomic measurements and the computed 2.4 TW working of the Moon on the global ocean. Second, the detection by RAY and MITCHUM (1996) of small surface manifestation of internal tides radiating away from the Hawaiian chain has led to global estimates of 0.2 to 0.4 TW of conversion of surface tides to internal tides. Measurements of ocean microstructure yields 0.2 TW of global dissipation by pelagic turbulence (away from topography). We propose that pelagic turbulence is maintained by topographic scattering of barotropic into baroclinic tidal energy, via internal tides and internal waves. Previous estimates by BAINES (1974); BAINES, (1982) of this conversion along 150,000 km of continental coastlines gave a negligible 0.02 TW; evidently the important conversion takes place along mid-ocean ridges. The maintenance of the abyssal global stratification requires a much larger expenditure of power, 2 TW versus 0.2 TW. This is usually attributed to wind forcing. If tidal power is to play a significant role here, then the BBL estimates need to be reduced. The challenge is to estimate dissipation from the energy flux divergence in the T/P adjusted tidal models, without prior assumptions concerning the dissipation processes.},

I have attemped, wiothout much success, to interpret ? froma variety of viewpoints: from mixing along the ocean boundaries, from thermodynamic and biological processes, and from internal tides. Following the work of Image and Image (1962), it is found that surface tides are scattered by the irregular bottom into modes with an associated energy flux of 4 × 10?6 ergs g?1 (one sixth total tidal dissipation). Such modes can produce shear instability in the Richardson sence. It is found that internal tides provides a marginal but not impossible mechanism for turbulent diffusion in the interior oceans.},

It develops a narrow strip of large negative vertical vorticity through the turbulent boundary layer and bottom stress. In several downstream locations, the current separates, aided by topographic curvature and flow inertia, in particular near Point Sur Ridge, south of Monterey Bay. When this happens the high-vorticity strip undergoes rapid instability that appears to be mesoscale in “eddy-resolving” simulations but is substantially submesoscale with a finer computational grid. The negative relative vorticity in the CUC is larger than the background rotation f, and Ertel potential vorticity is negative. This instigates ageostrophic centrifugal instability. The submesoscale turbulence is partly unbalanced, has elevated local dissipation and mixing, and leads to dilution of the extreme vorticity values.

abstract = {We obtain an analytic solution for the generation of internal gravity waves by tidal flow past a vertical barrier of height b in a uniformly stratified ocean of depth h {\textgreater} b and buoyancy frequency N. The radiated power (watts per metre of barrier) is  (1)/(4)pirho(0b)(2)U(2)N root1-(f/omega)M-2(b/h),  where rho(0) is the mean density of seawater, U cos(omegat) the tidal velocity, and f the Coriolis frequency. The function M(b/h) increases monotonically with M(0)=1, M(0.92) = 2 and M(1) = infinity. As b/h --{\textgreater} 1, M diverges logarithmically and consequently the radiated power grows as ln[(h - b)/b]. We also calculate the conversion in a realistically stratified ocean with strongly non-uniform buoyancy frequency, N(z). A rough approximation to the radiated power in this case is  (1)/(4)pirho(0)b(2)U(2) N(b)rootl -(fo) M(B/pi),  where N(b) is the buoyancy frequency at the tip of the ridge and B is the height of the ridge in WKB coordinates. (The WKB coordinate is normalized so that the total depth of the ocean is pi.) The approximation above is an over-estimate of the actual radiation by as much as 20{\%} when B/pi approximate to 0.8. But the formula correctly indicates the strong dependence of conversion on stratification through the factor N(b).},

Bell's formula for the conversion rate is extended to the case of an ocean of finite depth H with weak two-dimensional topography h(x, y) and arbitrary buoyancy frequency N(z). Approximate solutions are computed using the WKB method, which reduce to the previous result for an ocean of infinite depth with constant stratification. The conversion rate for a finite-depth ocean can be substantially smaller than the infinite-ocean prediction when the length scale of the topography is of the same order as the horizontal wavelength of the internal tide. The conversion rate for two-dimensional Gaussian seamounts is calculated. Using observed statistics for the distribution of seamounts, the authors estimate 1/4 GW of conversion for a square of ocean floor of side 1000 km.},

abstract = {The overturning circulation of the ocean plays an important role in modulating the Earth's climate. But whereas the mechanisms for the vertical transport of water into the deep ocean-deep water formation at high latitudes-and horizontal transport in ocean currents have been largely identified, it is not dear how the compensating vertical transport of water from the depths to the surface is accomplished. Turbulent mixing across surfaces of constant density is the only viable mechanism for reducing the density of the water and enabling it to rise. However, measurements of the internal wave field, the main source of energy for mixing, and of turbulent dissipation rates, have typically implied diffusivities across surfaces of equal density of only similar to 0.1 cm(2) s(-1) too small to account for the return flow. Here we report measurements of tracer dispersion and turbulent energy dissipation in the Brazil basin that reveal diffusivities of 2-4 cm(2) s(-1) at a depth of 500 m above abyssal hills on the flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and approximately 10 cm(2) s(-1) nearer the bottom. This amount of mixing, probably driven by breaking internal waves that are generated by tidal currents flowing over the rough bathymetry, may be large enough to dose the buoyancy budget for the Brazil basin and suggests a mechanism for closing the global overturning circulation.},

The parameterization requires knowledge of the topography, stratification, and the remote forcing, either barotropic or baroclinic. Internal modes that are arrested at the crest of the topography are assumed to dissipate, and faster modes assumed to propagate away. The energy flux into each mode is predicted using a knife-edge topography that allows linear numerical solutions. The parameterization is tested using high-resolution two-dimensional numerical models of barotropic and internal tides impinging on an isolated ridge, and for the generation problem on a two-ridge system. The recipe is seen to work well compared to numerical simulations of isolated ridges, so long as the ridge has a slope steeper than twice the critical steepness.

N is the buoyancy frequency, hm the height of the topography from the channel floor and Uo the flow speed infinitely far from the obstacle. As for moderate Nhm/Uo (∼1), a columnar response propagates far up- and downstream, and an arrested lee wave forms at the topography. Upstream, most of the water beneath the crest is blocked, while the moving layer above the crest has a mean velocity Um=UoH/(H − hm). The vertical wavelength implied by this velocity scale, $\lambda$o =2$\pi$Um/N, predicts dominant vertical scales in the flow. Upstream of the crest there is an accelerated region of fluid approximately $\lambda$o thick, above which there is a weakly oscillatory flow. Downstream the accelerated region is thicker and has less intense velocities. Similarly, the upstream lift of isopycnals is greatest in the first wavelength near the crest, and weaker above and below. Form drag on the obstacle is dominated by the blocked response, and not on the details of the lee wave, unlike flows with moderate Nhm/Uo. Directly downstream, the lee wave that forms has a vertical wavelength given by $\lambda$o, except for the deepest lobe which tends to be thicker. This wavelength is small relative to the fluid depth and topographic height, and has a horizontal phase speed cpx =−Um, corresponding to an arrested lee wave. When considering the spin-up to steady state, the speed of vertical propagation scales with the vertical component of group velocity cgz=$\alpha$Um, where $\alpha$ is the aspect ratio of the topography. This implies a time scale ˆt =tN$\alpha$/2$\pi$ for the growth of the lee waves, and that steady state is attained more rapidly with steep topography than shallow, in contrast with linear theory, which does not depend on the aspect ratio.},

abstract = {The scattering of mode-1 internal tides from idealized Gaussian topography in a nonrotating ocean with constant and realistic stratifications is examined with a primitive equation numerical model. Incident mode-1 energy fluxes of 20 and 2000Wm?1 are used to examine the linear regime and a more realistic situation. Simulations using two- dimensional or infinite ridges compare well with ray tracing methods and illustrate how the size and shape of the topography influence wave scattering. The height affects energy transmission and reflection, while the slope and width determine the conversion of low- mode internal tides into beams or higher modes. Three-dimensional topographic scattering is considered for seamounts, finite-width ridges, and islands. Scattering from finite ridges focuses wave energy directly downstream, while scattering from seamounts produces azimuthal energy dispersion. Scattering to higher wave modes occurs in the lee of near- critical and supercritical seamounts and ridges. Nonlinear interactions transfer energy into the mode-1 M4 internal tide. The Mellor-Yamada level-2.5 submodel parameterizes turbulent mixing. For the near-critical and supercritical ridges with realistic stratification, elevated mixing is found over the leading edge of the topography and along a tidal beam up to the first surface bounce. A transition from a beam structure near the topography to a low- mode structure farther away occurs due to an increased contribution from the mode-1 internal tide as it refracts around the topography and not due to turbulent dissipation. Internal tide scattering at topography leads to a loss of energy to mixing and to a redistribution of energy flux in space, frequency, and mode number.},

This allows for a more accurate analytical estimation of tidal conversion rates. Studies of single and double ridges reveal that the conversion rate and the nature of the radiated internal tide can be sensitive to the topographic shape, particularly around criticality and when there is interference between wave fields generated by neighbouring ridges.

abstract = {The coexistence in the deep ocean of a finite, stable stratification, a strong meridional overturning circulation, and mesoscale eddies raises complex ques- tions concerning the circulation energetics. In particular, small-scale mixing processes are necessary to resupply the potential energy removed in the interior by the overturning and eddy-generating process. A number of lines of evidence, none complete, suggest that the oceanic general circulation, far from being a heat engine, is almost wholly governed by the forcing of the wind field and secondarily by deepwater tides. In detail however, the budget of mechanical energy input into the ocean is poorly constrained. The now inescapable conclusion that over most of the ocean significant “vertical” mixing is confined to topographically complex boundary areas implies a potentially radically different interior circulation than is possible with uniform mixing. Whether ocean circulation models, either simple box or full numerical ones, neither explicitly accounting for the energy input into the system nor providing for spatial variability in the mixing, have any physical relevance under changed climate conditions is at issue.},

abstract = {Three years of temperature data along two transects extending to 90 m depth, at Palau, Micronesia, show twice-a-day thermocline vertical displacements of commonly 50-100 m, and on one occasion 270 m. The internal wave occurred at a number of frequencies. There were a number of spectral peaks at diurnal and semi-diurnal frequencies, as well as intermediate and sub-inertial frequencies, less so at the inertial frequency. At Palau the waves generally did not travel around the island because there was no coherence between internal waves on either side of the island. The internal waves at a site 30 km offshore were out-of-phase with those on the island slopes, suggesting that the waves were generated on the island slope and then radiated away. Palau Island was thus a source of internal wave energy for the surrounding ocean. A numerical model suggests that the tidal and low-frequency currents flowing around the island form internal waves with maximum wave amplitude on the island slope and that these waves radiate away from the island. The model also suggests that the headland at the southern tip of Palau prevents the internal waves to rotate around the island. The large temperature fluctuations (commonly daily fluctuations ???10??C, peaking at 20??C) appear responsible for generating a thermal stress responsible for a biologically depauperate biological community on the island slopes at depths between 60 and 120 m depth. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

                        -1, generating unsteady eddies in the lee of Guam. A number of transient eddies off the tips of the island were apparent, the smallest eddies were at the scale of local topographic features such as headlands and embayments, while other eddies were island size. In addition to eddies off the tips of the island, a large (200 km in diameter) cyclonic oceanic eddy was advected eastward past Guam during the last 2 weeks of August 2000. Centered on Guam for a few days, this eddy formed elsewhere and impinged on the island generating anticlockwise currents around the island of up to 0.5 m s

It is suggested that these eddies are sufficiently energetic to return fish and coral eggs and larvae to their natal reefs in Guam, thereby enabling self-seeding of coral reefs in Guam.

abstract = {Observations of turbulent dissipation above rough bathymetry in the abyssal Brazil Basin are presented. Relative to regions with smooth bathymetry, dissipation is markedly enhanced above rough topography of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with levels above bathymetric slopes exceeding levels observed over crests and canyon floors. Furthermore, mixing levels in rough areas are modulated by the spring-neap tidal cycle. Internal waves generated by barotropic tidal flow over topography are the likely mechanism for supplying the energy needed to support the observed turbulent dissipation. A model of the spatial and temporal patterns in the turbulent dissipation rate is used to constrain the diapycnal advection in an inverse calculation for the circulation in an area of rough bathymetry. This inverse model uses both beta-spiral and integrated forms of the advective budgets for heat, mass, and vorticity, and contains sufficient information to resolve the full three-dimensional flow. The inverse model solution reveals the presence of a bouyancy forced circulation driven by mixing in abyssal canyons. On isopycnals above the level of fracture-zone crests near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the flow is westward and fluid is downwelled toward greater density. Along deeper isopycnals, fluid is carried eastward and upwelled in canyons. The divergence of diapycnal mass flux is a significant forcing mechanism for this circulation. These results suggest that mixing in abyssal canyons plays an important role in the circulation of abyssal waters.},

Our special concern is the response of the fluid when the Froude number is near or less than unity. Linear theory is inapplicable in this range of Froude number, and the present numerical solutions show the rich variety of phenomena that emerge in this essentially nonlinear flow regime. Two such phenomena, which occupy Parts I and II of this study, are the formation of a pair of vertically oriented vortices on the lee side and a zone of flow reversal on the windward side of the obstacle. The Ice vortices have been explained as a consequence of the separation of the viscous boundary layer from the obstacle however, this boundary layer is absent (by design) in the present experiments and lee vortices still occur. We argue that a vertical component of vorticity develops on the lee side owing to the tilting of horizontally oriented vorticity produced baroclinically as the isentropes deform in r...},

abstract = {Internal wave theory is used to examine the generation, radiation, and energy dissipation of internal tides in the deep ocean. Estimates of vertical energy flux based on a previously developed model are adjusted to account for the influence of finite depth, varying stratification, and two-dimensional topography. Specific estimates of energy flux are made for midocean ridge topography. Weakly nonlinear theory is applied to the wave generation at idealized topography to examine finite amplitude corrections to the linear theory. Most internal tide energy is generated at low modes associated with spatial scales from roughly 20 to 100 km. The Richardson number of the radiated internal tide typically exceeds unity for these motions, and so direct shear instability of the generated waves is not the dominant energy transfer mechanism. It also seems that wave–wave interactions are ineffective at transferring energy from the large wavelengths that dominate the energy flux. Instead, it appears that most of the internal tide energy is radiated over O(1000 km) distances. A small fraction of energy flux, less than 30{\%}, is generated at smaller spatial scales, and this energy flux may dissipate locally. Estimates along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the South Atlantic suggest that the vertical energy flux of M 2 internal tides is 3–5 mW m Ϫ2 , with 1–2 mW m Ϫ2 likely contributing to local mixing. Along the East Pacific Rise, bathymetry is more smooth and tides are weaker, and estimates suggest internal tide energy flux is negligible. Radiated low modes are likely influenced by topographic scattering, though general topography scatters less than 10{\%} of the low-mode energy to higher wavenumbers. Thus, low-mode internal tides may contribute to mixing at locations far away from their generation sites.},

The formation and spread of a region of collapsed density surfaces is predicted on the leeward slope. Two incipient stagnation points are predicted, one on the windward slope and one some distance aloft, above the mountaintop. In satisfying the LBC exactly, a correction to the pressure arises which cancels the Bernoulii "height term' in Sheppard's blocking analysis.

abstract = {Astronomical data reveals that approximately 3.5 terawatts (TW) of tidal energy is dissipated in the ocean. Tidal models and satellite altimetry suggest that 1 TW of this energy is converted from the barotropic to internal tides in the deep ocean, predominantly around regions of rough topography such as mid-ocean ridges. A global tidal model is used to compute turbulent energy levels associated with the dissipation of internal tides, and the diapycnal mixing supported by this energy flux is computed using a simple parameterization.The mixing parameterization has been incorporated into a coarse resolution numerical model of the global ocean. This parameterization offers an energetically consistent and practical means of improving the representation of ocean mixing processes in climate models. Novel features of this implementation are that the model explicitly accounts for the tidal energy source for mixing, and that the mixing evolves both spatially and temporally with the model state. At equilibrium, the globally averaged diffusivity profile ranges from 0.3 cm2 s-1 at thermocline depths to 7.7 cm2 s-1 in the abyss with a depth average of 0.9 cm2 s-1, in close agreement with inferences from global balances. Water properties are strongly influenced by the combination of weak mixing in the main thermocline and enhanced mixing in the deep ocean. Climatological comparisons show that the parameterized mixing scheme results in a substantial reduction of temperature/salinity bias relative to model solutions with either a uniform vertical diffusivity of 0.9 cm2 s-1 or a horizontally uniform bottom-intensified arctangent mixing profile. This suggests that spatially varying bottom intensified mixing is an essential component of the balances required for the maintenance of the ocean's abyssal stratification. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the results of linear theory, other causes of steepening such as mountain asymmetry, vertical variation of wind, stability, density and mountain isolation can be estimated.

A 'composite model' involving wave generation on a shallow thermocline as well as on the continuously stratified fluid below is developed, together with a discussion of the approximations required. The simple case of a linear slope is discussed in detail; one conclusion is that linear internal tides generated on a shallow thermocline will be small unless T = hL/L$\alpha$ {\textless} 2, where hL is the total depth on the continental shelf, 2$\pi$L is a representative wavelength (typically 20 to 30 km) and $\alpha$ is the slope of the continental slope. Such waves propagating seawards are expected to 'leak' into the deeper stratified water in one or two wavelengths, whilst those propagating shorewards on the shelf may steepen to form undular bores. The composite model has been applied to all relevant regions of coastline, and the five areas with the largest internal tidal energy production are the European northwest shelf, the East and South China seas, the Guiana Basin region, the Australian northwest shelf, and the Gulf of Maine-Grand Banks region. The summed global barotropic to baroclinic tidal energy conversions by this process in the coastal regions are estimated to be 1.45 × 1010 J s-1 for M2 and 2.73 × 109 J s-1 for S2, on an annual mean basis. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

The model captures 93{\%} of the open-ocean sea-surface height variance of the eight largest tidal constituents, as recorded by a standard set of 102 pelagic tide gauges spread around the World Ocean. In order to minimize the impact of the wave drag on non-tidal motions, the model utilizes a running 25-h average to approximately separate tidal and non-tidal components of the near-bottom flow. In contrast to earlier high-resolution global baroclinic tide simulations, which utilized tidal forcing only, the simulation presented here has a horizontally non-uniform stratification, supported by the wind- and buoyancy forcing. The horizontally varying stratification affects the baroclinic tides in high latitudes to first order. The magnitude of the internal tide perturbations to sea surface elevation amplitude and phase in a large box surrounding Hawai'i is quite similar to that observed in satellite altimeter data, although the exact locations of peaks and troughs in the modeled perturbations differ from those in the observed perturbations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Rough topography on the ocean floor is a source of ocean mixing which is of interest to both physical oceanography and climate science. Most mixing has been attributed to high slopes of the large-scale structures of the deep ocean floor such as seamounts, continental margins, and mid-ocean ridge axes. In this paper, we show the small-scale but ubiquitous abyssal hills and fracture zones dominate the global map of rough topography. Much of this rugged seafloor occurs in the Southern Ocean on the flanks of the Pacific-Antarctic Rise and Southwest Indian Ridge. We present our results as a global map of the mean slope of the ocean floor, and as a global map of the ocean floor above the M-2 critical slope. We compare our results to multibeam and satellite bathymetry data to show that satellite bathymetry is not a valid proxy for multibeam measurements, but edited single-beam sonar data are adequate to provide a global perspective on features with horizontal wavelengths as small as 2 km.},

Attention is primarily directed to the behaviour of the solution in various limiting cases, and to estimating the flux of energy into the internal wave field. In general, waves are generated not only at the fundamental frequency $\omega$0, but also at all of its harmonics. But, for values of $\omega$0/N greater than about one half, the waves of fundamental frequency are dominant. For values of $\omega$0/N, less than about one half, the quasi-static approximation, in which the problem is considered as a slowly-varying version of the classical lee wave problem, is found to provide a viable estimate for the wave field. The general solution is found to compare favourably with the limited available experimental data.},

abstract = {One hundred and twelve stations of CTDO2 and LADCP were collected in the Agulhas Current system as part of the Agulhas Undercurrent experiment (AUCE) in March 2003. Along an offshore section, at approximately 35.6??S and 27.3??E to the northwest of the tip of the Agulhas Plateau, an unusual feature was revealed between 2200 and 3500 m depth, imbedded in the northward moving NADW layer. An anomalously high salinity of 34.83, 0.03 saltier than the surrounding water, was observed. Maximums in the potential temperature and oxygen were also found, with isotherms dropping by about 250 m over 50 km and a doming of the oxygen layers. From the convex lens structure of the neutral surfaces, we conclude that we sampled an anticyclonic eddy of NADW. Since the LADCP data reveal deep velocities up to 20 cm s-1, yet no anticyclonic circulation, whereas the geostrophic velocity referenced to the bottom shows a weak anticyclonic circulation, we inferred that we sampled the outer edge of the eddy and not its core. From an analysis of the water properties within the eddy and a comparison with known properties in the SE Atlantic Ocean and SW Indian Ocean, we conclude that the eddy was formed in the Agulhas Retroflection region. We speculate that the eddy was the result of an instability in the NADW slope current, which flows from the SE Atlantic around the Agulhas Bank. A deeply penetrating Agulhas Ring spun up the deep waters, pinching off an eddy, which later detached from the slope current and was carried southward. Once offshore, it coupled with the surface Agulhas Return Current, whose meandering path advected the eddy northeastward and ejected it over the Agulhas Plateau. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The wavelength of internal tides can be as much as 250 km in the open ocean, but as the generation of these tides depends on the angle between the depth-averaged current and the topography, there can be considerable local spatial variability. This range of scales makes it difficult to develop a comprehensive understanding of the processes involved from observations alone. Regional numerical modeling provides a way to study the generation and early propagation of internal tides at high resolution.

abstract = {The concept of a long-term (20-30 year) systematic, international effort to map the entire world seafloor from beach to trench (GOMaP = Global Ocean Mapping Program) has been developing at a series of informal and formal meetings over the last 2 years. The goal of GOMaP is to systematically map the ocean floors with at least 100 per cent coverage sidescan and swath bathymetry, and to perform whatever other data collection could be carried out simultaneously (e.g., subbottom profiling, magnetics, gravity, physical oceanography and meteorology). Minimum standards for data accuracy, pixel navigation, and resolution have been recommended. Spatial resolutions for GOMaP sidescan sonar imagery should be 100 m or better in the deep sea. This is comparable to what has been achieved by the Shuttle Imaging Radar over the terrestrial earth, the MAGELLAN radar mapping of Venus, the MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR and other probes on Mars, and the GALILEO mission to the moons of Jupiter. Although spatial resolution for swath bathymetry is slightly less than for sidescan, the resolution of both systems improves sharply with decreasing water depths, particularly for the 10 per cent of the world ocean less than 500 m deep. The decrease of swath width with water depth implies that over 600 ship years are required to map waters 25-500 m deep, compared to just approximately 200 ship years for the deep ocean (500 m and greater). Better pixel navigation accuracy suggests hull-mounted systems (9-16 kHz for deep water, and 30 kHz or higher for shelf waters) may be superior to towed systems, although improvements in towed system navigation instrumentation and techniques may mitigate this difference in the future. Seafloor mapping with air-deployed hyperspectral and laser bathym{\'{e}}trie scanning may be required to replace or supplement shipborne mapping in clear waters less than 50 m deep.},

The particular focus is on the effects of a zonal topographic slope, comparedwith the effects of ameridional slope.A zonal slope always destabilizes background zonal flows that are otherwise stable in the absence of topography regardless of the slope magnitude, whereas the meridional slopes stabilize/destabilize zonal flows only through changing the lower-level background potential vorticity gradient beyond a known critical value. Growth rates, phase speeds, and vertical structure of the growing solutions strongly depend on the slope magnitude. In the numerical simulations configured with an isolatedmeridional ridge, unstablemodes develop on both sides of the ridge and propagate eastward of the ridge, in agreement with analytical results. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

@article{Chavanne2010a,
abstract = {The evolution of a submesoscale anticyclonic vortex was observed by high-frequency Doppler radio current meters and satellite radiometers. The vortex formed between two large cyclones to the southwest of Oahu, Hawaii. The radius of the core was 15 km; the azimuthal velocity reached 35 cm s-1; and the surface vorticity remained below -f for 9 days, reaching an extremum of -1.7f. The flow was ageostrophic near the center and around the periphery of the vortex. The initial growth may have been driven by negative wind stress curl in the lee of Oahu. The vortex was prone to inertial, symmetric, and anticyclonic ageostrophic instabilities, but the temporal evolution of radial profiles of vorticity was inconsistent with angular momentum redistribution by inertial instability. A tongue of surface water 0.7C warmer became entrained northward between the vortex and the colder cyclone to the west. As the vortex strengthened, a 0.14 C km-1 front formed along the eastern flank of the tongue. The sea surface temperature gradient remained weaker on the western flank. The flow was anticyclonic (-0.4f ) and divergent (0.1f ) on the warm side of the front but cyclonic (0.6f ) and convergent (-0.2f ) on the cold side. This suggests ageostrophic cross-frontal circulations maintaining alongfront thermal wind balance in the presence of large-scale strain S. Surface divergence d was proportional to vorticity zeta during the 3-day frontogenesis: d=-(S/f )zeta. This is consistent with a semigeostrophic model of a front confined to a surface layer of zero potential vorticity.},

abstract = {Scatterometer data at 25-km resolution are used to investigate the effects of the Hawaiian and Cabo Verde islands on the mean atmospheric flow. A wake of weak winds, flanked by accelerated winds, appears for each major island of both archipelagos. The resulting wind stress curl displays dipole-like structures, with positive values on the northern side and negative values on the southern side of the lee, extending several island diameters downwind. These curl anomalies reach a magnitude of 2 10(-6) Pa(.)m(-1) and correspond to Ekman pumping velocities of 3 m(.)day(-1) for Hawaii and 4 m(.)day(-1) for Cabo Verde. They spin up cyclonic eddies on the north side and anticyclonic eddies on the south side of the lee of each island. The response of the ocean circulation is investigated using a simple Sverdrup balance. Two counter-rotating Sverdrup gyres are spun up west of the island of Hawaii and extend to the western boundary of the Pacific Ocean. They result in an eastward zonal transport confined between 19degrees and 20degreesN. East of 170degreesW, the surface expression of this transport coincides with the Hawaiian Lee Counter Current. Similar gyres are anticipated to form in the Atlantic Ocean, but remain to be observed. These results suggest that strong mesoscale patterns in the wind field occurring in the lee of high-topography features must be resolved to force global ocean circulation models.},

abstract = {Abstract We examine the evolution of a field of internal waves launched by stratified flow over symmetric topography in mean flows which reverse direction at some height above the surface. With the gradient Richardson number at this “critical level” in the undisturbed flow restricted to values greater than 0.25, the nonlinear interaction in the region is such that the surface strongly reflects large amplitude internal waves incident upon it. When the critical level is located near certain discrete heights above the ground the incident and reflected waves interfere constructively and the wave amplitude in the low levels is resonantly enhanced by a large factor. These results are related to our previous analyses of the process by which breaking internal waves are able to induce intense downslope windstorms.},

abstract = {Advances in computing are enabling atmospheric models to operate at increasingly fine resolution, giving rise to more variations in the underlying orography being captured by the model grid. Consequently, high-resolution models must overcome the problems associated with traditional terrain-following approaches of spurious winds and instabilities generated in the vicinity of steep and complex terrain. Cut-cell representations of orography present atmospheric models with an alternative to terrain-following vertical coordinates. This work explores the capabilities of a cut-cell representation of orography for idealized orographically forced flows. The orographic surface is represented within the model by continuous piecewise bilinear surfaces that intersect the regular Cartesian grid creating cut cells. An approximate finite-volume method for use with advection-form governing equations is implemented to solve flows through the resulting irregularly shaped grid boxes. Comparison with a benchmark orographic test case for nonhydrostatic flow shows very good results. Further tests demonstrate the cut-cell method for flow around 3D isolated hills and stably resolving flows over very steep orography.},

abstract = {AbstractA parameterization is presented for turbulence dissipation due to internal tides generated at and impinging upon topography steep enough to be “supercritical” with respect to the tide. The parameterization requires knowledge of the topography, stratification, and the remote forcing—either barotropic or baroclinic. Internal modes that are arrested at the crest of the topography are assumed to dissipate, and faster modes assumed to propagate away. The energy flux into each mode is predicted using a knife-edge topography that allows linear numerical solutions. The parameterization is tested using high-resolution two-dimensional numerical models of barotropic and internal tides impinging on an isolated ridge, and for the generation problem on a two-ridge system. The recipe is seen to work well compared to numerical simulations of isolated ridges, so long as the ridge has a slope steeper than twice the critical steepness.

abstract = {Satellite altimetry and high-resolution ocean models indicate that the Southern Ocean comprises an in- tricate web of narrow, meandering jets that undergo spontaneous formation, merger, and splitting events, as well as rapid latitude shifts over periods of weeks to months. The role of topography in controlling jet vari- ability is explored using over 100 simulations from a doubly periodic, forced-dissipative, two-layer quasi- geostrophic model. The system is forced by a baroclinically unstable, vertically sheared mean flow in a domain that is large enough to accommodate multiple jets. The dependence of (i) meridional jet spacing, (ii) jet variability, and (iii) domain-averaged meridional transport on changes in the length scale and steepness of simple sinusoidal topographical features is analyzed. The Rhines scale, b 5 2p p Ve/b vorticity gradient, measures the meridional extent of eddy mixing by a single jet. The ratio b/T, where T is the topographic length scale, governs jet behavior. Multiple, steady jets with fixed meridional spacing are observed when bT or when b T. When b , T, a pattern of perpetual jet formation and jet merger dominates the time evolution of the system. Zonal ridges systematically reduce the domain-averaged me- ridional transport, while two-dimensional, sinusoidal bumps can increase transport by an order of magnitude or more. For certain parameters, bumpy topography gives rise to periodic oscillations in the jet structure between purely zonal and topographically steered states. In these cases, transport is dominated by bursts of mixing associated with the transition between the two regimes. Topography modifies local potential vorticity (PV) gradients and mean flows; this can generate asymmetric Reynolds stresses about the jet core and can feed back on the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy through baroclinic instability. Both pro- cesses contribute to unsteady jet behavior. It is likely that these processes play a role in the dynamic nature of Southern Ocean jets. , where Ve is an eddy velocity scale and b is the barotropic potential 1.

abstract = {Fine- and microstructure profiles collected over Fieberling Seamount at 32°26′N in the eastern North Pacific reveal a variety of intensified baroclinic motions driven by astronomical diurnal tides. The forced response consists of three phenomena coexisting in a layer 200 m thick above the summit plain: (i) an anticyclonic vortex cap of core relative vorticity - 0.5f, (ii) diurnal fluctuations of ±15 cm s-1 amplitude and 200-m vertical wavelength, and (iii) turbulence levels corresponding to an eddy diffusivity Ke ≅ 10 × 10-4 m2 s-1. The vortex cannot be explained by Taylor-Proudman dynamics because of its -0.3fN2 negative potential vorticity anomaly. The ±0.3f fortnightly cycle in the vortex's strength suggests that it is at least partially maintained against dissipative erosion by tidal rectification. The diurnal motions are slightly subinertial, turning clockwise in time and counterclockwise with depth over the summit plain. They also exhibit a fortnightly cycle in their amplitude, pointing to seamount amplification of impinging barotropic tides. Their horizontal structure resembles that of a seamount-trapped topographic wave. However, the counterclockwise turning with depth of the horizontal velocity vector and the 180° phase difference between radial velocity u′r and vertical displacement $\xi$′= -T′/T̄z{\^{O}}'/{\^{O}}. (producing a net positive radial heat flux 〈u′rT′〉) are more consistent with a vortex-trapped near-inertial internal wave of upward energy propagation. The strong negative vorticity of the vortex cap allows the diurnal frequency to be effectively superinertial; that is, diurnal fluctuations satisfy a hyperbolic equation within the vortex. A vortextrapped wave would encounter a vertical critical layer at the top of the cap where its energy would be lost to turbulence. Observed turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates of $\epsilon$ = 3 × 10-8 W kg-1 are sufficiently high to deplete the wave and vortex in less than 3 days, emphasizing the strongly forced/damped nature of the system. Inferred eddy diffusivities two orders of magnitude larger than those found in the ocean interior suggest that, locally, seamounts are important sites for diapycnal transport. On basin scales, however, there are too few seamounts or ridges penetrating the main pycnocline to support a basin-averaged diffusivity of O(10-4 m2 s-1) above 3000-m depth.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper proposes and discusses mechanisms whereby mean flows and jets are produced by differential rotation and by topographic effects. It is shown that, in general, a mean gradient of potential vorticity not only inhibits the cascade of energy to large scales but directly produces anisotropic structures. Scalings for this are examined on the $\beta$ plane using ideas from classical phenomenology. The scalings are naturally anisotropic and predict the formation of zonal flows directly through a turbulent cascade. Numerical simulations and two-point closure calculations qualitatively confirm the predictions. Also, simulations of barotropic flow on the $\beta$ plane can produce zonal jet structures of exceptional persistence over many eddy turnover times. Unsteady flow over topography generally produces a mean flow with a correlation between streamfunction and topography, with anticyclonic motion over humps.

But whereas the mechanisms for the vertical transport of water into the deep ocean-deep water formation at high latitudes-and horizontal transport in ocean currents have been largely identified, it is not dear how the compensating vertical transport of water from the depths to the surface is accomplished. Turbulent mixing across surfaces of constant density is the only viable mechanism for reducing the density of the water and enabling it to rise. However, measurements of the internal wave field, the main source of energy for mixing, and of turbulent dissipation rates, have typically implied diffusivities across surfaces of equal density of only similar to 0.1 cm(2) s(-1) too small to account for the return flow. Here we report measurements of tracer dispersion and turbulent energy dissipation in the Brazil basin that reveal diffusivities of 2-4 cm(2) s(-1) at a depth of 500 m above abyssal hills on the flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and approximately 10 cm(2) s(-1) nearer the bottom. This amount of mixing, probably driven by breaking internal waves that are generated by tidal currents flowing over the rough bathymetry, may be large enough to dose the buoyancy budget for the Brazil basin and suggests a mechanism for closing the global overturning circulation.},

abstract = {The concept of a long-term (20-30 year) systematic, international effort to map the entire world seafloor from beach to trench (GOMaP = Global Ocean Mapping Program) has been developing at a series of informal and formal meetings over the last 2 years. The goal of GOMaP is to systematically map the ocean floors with at least 100 per cent coverage sidescan and swath bathymetry, and to perform whatever other data collection could be carried out simultaneously (e.g., subbottom profiling, magnetics, gravity, physical oceanography and meteorology). Minimum standards for data accuracy, pixel navigation, and resolution have been recommended. Spatial resolutions for GOMaP sidescan sonar imagery should be 100 m or better in the deep sea. This is comparable to what has been achieved by the Shuttle Imaging Radar over the terrestrial earth, the MAGELLAN radar mapping of Venus, the MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR and other probes on Mars, and the GALILEO mission to the moons of Jupiter. Although spatial resolution for swath bathymetry is slightly less than for sidescan, the resolution of both systems improves sharply with decreasing water depths, particularly for the 10 per cent of the world ocean less than 500 m deep. The decrease of swath width with water depth implies that over 600 ship years are required to map waters 25-500 m deep, compared to just approximately 200 ship years for the deep ocean (500 m and greater). Better pixel navigation accuracy suggests hull-mounted systems (9-16 kHz for deep water, and 30 kHz or higher for shelf waters) may be superior to towed systems, although improvements in towed system navigation instrumentation and techniques may mitigate this difference in the future. Seafloor mapping with air-deployed hyperspectral and laser bathym{\'{e}}trie scanning may be required to replace or supplement shipborne mapping in clear waters less than 50 m deep.},

abstract = {Abstract Internal wave theory is used to examine the generation, radiation, and energy dissipation of internal tides in the deep ocean. Estimates of vertical energy flux based on a previously developed model are adjusted to account for the influence of finite depth, varying stratification, and two-dimensional topography. Specific estimates of energy flux are made for midocean ridge topography. Weakly nonlinear theory is applied to the wave generation at idealized topography to examine finite amplitude corrections to the linear theory. Most internal tide energy is generated at low modes associated with spatial scales from roughly 20 to 100 km. The Richardson number of the radiated internal tide typically exceeds unity for these motions, and so direct shear instability of the generated waves is not the dominant energy transfer mechanism. It also seems that wave?wave interactions are ineffective at transferring energy from the large wavelengths that dominate the energy flux. Instead, it appears that most of the internal tide energy is radiated over O(1000 km) distances. A small fraction of energy flux, less than 30{\%}, is generated at smaller spatial scales, and this energy flux may dissipate locally. Estimates along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the South Atlantic suggest that the vertical energy flux of M2 internal tides is 3?5 mW m?2, with 1?2 mW m?2 likely contributing to local mixing. Along the East Pacific Rise, bathymetry is more smooth and tides are weaker, and estimates suggest internal tide energy flux is negligible. Radiated low modes are likely influenced by topographic scattering, though general topography scatters less than 10{\%} of the low-mode energy to higher wavenumbers. Thus, low-mode internal tides may contribute to mixing at locations far away from their generation sites.},

Linear theory, corrected for finite-amplitude topography based on idealized, two-dimensional numerical simulations, has been recently used to estimate the global distribution of internal wave generation by oceanic currents and eddies. The global estimate shows that the topographic wave generation is a significant sink of energy for geostrophic flows and a source of energy for turbulent mixing in the deep ocean. However, comparison with recent observations from the Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean shows that the linear theory predictions and idealized two-dimensional simulations grossly overestimate the observed levels of turbulent energy dissipation. This study presents two- and three-dimensional, realistic topography simulations of internal lee-wave generation from a steady flow interacting with topography with parameters typical of Drake Passage. The results demonstrate that internal wave generation at three-dimensional, finite bottom topography is reduced compared to the two-dimensional case. The reduction is primarily associated with finite-amplitude bottom topography effects that suppress vertical motions and thus reduce the amplitude of the internal waves radiated from topography. The implication of these results for the global lee-wave generation is discussed.},

abstract = {Profiles of diapycnal eddy diffusivity to a maximum depth of 4000 meters were derived from ocean velocity and temperature microstructure data obtained in conjunction with separate experiments in the Northeast Pacific and Northeast Atlantic oceans. These profiles indicate that in the ocean interior where the internal wave field is at background intensity, the diapycnal eddy diffusivity is small (on the order of 0.1 x 10(-4) meters squared per second) and independent of depth, in apparent contradiction with large-scale budget studies. Enhanced dissipation is observed in regions of elevated internal wave energy, particularly near steeply sloping boundaries (where the eddy diffusivity estimates exceed 1 x 10(-4) meters squared per second). These results suggest that basin-averaged mixing rates may be dominated by processes occurring near the ocean boundaries.},

abstract = {Oceanic density overturns are commonly used to parameterize the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy. This method assumes a linear scaling between the Thorpe length scale LT and the Ozmidov length scale LO. Historic evidence supporting LT ; LO has been shown for relatively weak shear-driven turbulence of the thermocline; however, little support for the method exists in regions of turbulence driven by the convective collapse of topographically influenced overturns that are large by open-ocean standards. This study presents a direct comparison of LT and LO, using vertical profiles of temperature and microstructure shear collected in the Luzon Strait—a site characterized by topographically influenced overturns up to O(100) m in scale. The comparison is also done for open-ocean sites in the Brazil basin and North Atlantic where overturns are generally smaller and due to different processes. A key result is that LT/LO increases with overturn size in a fashion similar to that observed in numerical studies of Kelvin–Helmholtz (K–H) instabilities for all sites but is most clear in data from the Luzon Strait. Resultant bias in parameterized dissipation is mitigated by ensemble averaging; however, a positive bias appears when instantaneous observations are depth and time integrated. For a series of profiles taken during a spring tidal period in the Luzon Strait, the integrated value is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that based on the microstructure observations. Physical arguments supporting LT ; LO are revisited, and conceptual regimes explaining the relationship between LT/LO and a nondimensional overturn size L c T are proposed. In a companion paper, Scotti obtains similar conclusions from energetics arguments and simulations.},

abstract = {Much recent observational evidence suggests that energy from the barotropic tides can be used for mixing in the deep ocean. Here the process of internal-tide generation and dissipation by tidal flow over an isolated Gaussian topography is examined, using two-dimensional numerical simulations employing the MITgcm. Four different topographies are considered, for five different amplitudes of barotropic forcing, thereby allowing a variety of combinations of key nondimensional parameters. While much recent attention has focused on the role of relative topographic steepness and height in modifying the rate of conversion of energy from barotropic to baroclinic modes, here attention is focused on parameters dependent on the flow amplitude. For narrow topography, large amplitude forcing gives rise to baroclinic responses at higher harmonics of the forcing frequency. Tall narrow topographies are found to be the most conducive to mixing. Dissipation rates in these calculations are most efficient for the narrowest topography. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A primitive equation numerical model is used to systematically investigate wake formations at Cato Island (155°32′E, 23°15′S) under a variety of realistic flow conditions. The model faithfully reproduces the key features of data obtained in the vicinity of the island under conditions of “strong” () and “weak” () incident currents. For the strong inflow study, a vortex shedding wake is indicated, with an eddy shedding period of approximately . Interaction between wake and free stream currents produces strong downwelling and upwelling in regions of flow convergence and divergence, respectively. For the weak inflow case, a Lagrangian analysis of wake currents shows strong particle retention properties and vertical pumping in the wake; these results are consistent with observations of nutrient uplift and biological enhancement (the “island mass effect”) in the vicinity of the island in February, 1993. Numerical sensitivity experiments demonstrate that incident flow speed, background rotation rate and coastal island geometry each have a strong controlling influence on wake formations. Increasing the background rotation rate reduces the frequency of eddy shedding, while disproportionately increasing the circulation strength within shed eddies. For the biologically important non-shedding flow scenario, Lagrangian wake characteristics are examined in detail using the float-tracking scheme of the numerical model. It is found that unsteadiness severely compromises wake retention of passively drifting particles. Coastal geometry also has a strong controlling influence on wake retention. The numerical experiments suggest that particle retention in island wakes has a “hair trigger” characteristic controlled by incident flow speed and direction. This simple but powerful observation is used as the basis for a new proposal to explain the long-standing recruitment problem of biological oceanography. Good overall agreement between field data and numerical predictions further establishes two-dimensional representations of island topography as a viable and computationally efficient alternative to full, three-dimensional modelling, when the modelled flows are “dynamically deep”.},

The wavelength of internal tides can be as much as 250 km in the open ocean, but as the generation of these tides depends on the angle between the depth-averaged current and the topography, there can be considerable local spatial variability. This range of scales makes it difficult to develop a comprehensive understanding of the processes involved from observations alone. Regional numerical modeling provides a way to study the generation and early propagation of internal tides at high resolution. Here, we review the role that regional internal tide models, primarily hydrostatic models, can play in increasing our understanding.},

abstract = {Two and three-dimensional oceanic flows around small islands patterned after Barbados, W.I. (13 degrees 10' N latitude: 59 degrees 30' W longitude) were modeled numerically to investigate island wake effects. The two-dimensional simulations closely agreed with laboratory flows, for both attached and shedding wake regimes. As expected, results for a flat bottom confirmed that the Coriolis terms strongly affect pressure but not the flow. For idealized, yet typical incident dow speeds, water column stratification, island topography and appropriate Coriolis terms, three-dimensional simulations readily produced elongated wake patterns, dominated by surface intensified von Karman-like vortices. Effects of grid resolution, viscosity, bathymetry, and Coriolis forces on wake characteristics were studied. For islands with typical bottom slopes, realistically small horizontal eddy diffusivity has a minor effect compared to bottom drag in generating vorticity. Near-shore bathymetry (viz., the absence or presence of a continental shelf surrounding the island) plays a major role in determining the scale, intensity, and shedding period of the vortices. The addition of a 15 km wide continental shelf around the island increased the shedding period by 67{\%}, while reducing the Coriolis force by 50{\%} reduced the period by only 14{\%}. Although observational data is sparse, inferred flow patterns do show von Karman-like structures near Barbados, even if eddies are not located exactly as expected. The numerical computations demonstrate that shedding eddy wakes are easily generated, and lend encouragement to the further search for organized wakes downstream of the island.},

In the Atlantic Ocean, the deep western boundary current is estimated to carry (10-40) x 10(6) m3 s(-1) of water, transporting North Atlantic Deep Water--from the overflow regions between Greenland and Scotland and from the Labrador Sea--into the South Atlantic and the Antarctic circumpolar current. Here we present direct velocity and water mass observations obtained in the period 2000 to 2003, as well as results from a numerical ocean circulation model, showing that the Atlantic deep western boundary current breaks up at 8 degrees S. Southward of this latitude, the transport of North Atlantic Deep Water into the South Atlantic Ocean is accomplished by migrating eddies, rather than by a continuous flow. Our model simulation indicates that the deep western boundary current breaks up into eddies at the present intensity of meridional overturning circulation. For weaker overturning, continuation as a stable, laminar boundary flow seems possible.},

abstract = {One hundred and twelve stations of CTDO2 and LADCP were collected in the Agulhas Current system as part of the Agulhas Undercurrent experiment (AUCE) in March 2003. Along an offshore section, at approximately 35.6??S and 27.3??E to the northwest of the tip of the Agulhas Plateau, an unusual feature was revealed between 2200 and 3500 m depth, imbedded in the northward moving NADW layer. An anomalously high salinity of 34.83, 0.03 saltier than the surrounding water, was observed. Maximums in the potential temperature and oxygen were also found, with isotherms dropping by about 250 m over 50 km and a doming of the oxygen layers. From the convex lens structure of the neutral surfaces, we conclude that we sampled an anticyclonic eddy of NADW. Since the LADCP data reveal deep velocities up to 20 cm s-1, yet no anticyclonic circulation, whereas the geostrophic velocity referenced to the bottom shows a weak anticyclonic circulation, we inferred that we sampled the outer edge of the eddy and not its core. From an analysis of the water properties within the eddy and a comparison with known properties in the SE Atlantic Ocean and SW Indian Ocean, we conclude that the eddy was formed in the Agulhas Retroflection region. We speculate that the eddy was the result of an instability in the NADW slope current, which flows from the SE Atlantic around the Agulhas Bank. A deeply penetrating Agulhas Ring spun up the deep waters, pinching off an eddy, which later detached from the slope current and was carried southward. Once offshore, it coupled with the surface Agulhas Return Current, whose meandering path advected the eddy northeastward and ejected it over the Agulhas Plateau. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper presents a five-year global simulation of HYCOM, the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model, that simultaneously resolves the eddying general circulation, barotropic tides, and baroclinic tides with 32 layers in the vertical direction and 1/12.5?? (equatorial) horizontal grid spacing. A parameterized topographic wave drag is inserted into the model and tuned so that the surface tidal elevations are of comparable accuracy to those in optimally tuned forward tide models used in previous studies. The model captures 93{\%} of the open-ocean sea-surface height variance of the eight largest tidal constituents, as recorded by a standard set of 102 pelagic tide gauges spread around the World Ocean. In order to minimize the impact of the wave drag on non-tidal motions, the model utilizes a running 25-h average to approximately separate tidal and non-tidal components of the near-bottom flow. In contrast to earlier high-resolution global baroclinic tide simulations, which utilized tidal forcing only, the simulation presented here has a horizontally non-uniform stratification, supported by the wind- and buoyancy forcing. The horizontally varying stratification affects the baroclinic tides in high latitudes to first order. The magnitude of the internal tide perturbations to sea surface elevation amplitude and phase in a large box surrounding Hawai'i is quite similar to that observed in satellite altimeter data, although the exact locations of peaks and troughs in the modeled perturbations differ from those in the observed perturbations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Its long axis is inclined at about 60 {\o} into the direction of the dominant semidiurnal tidal current. The length of the wake in the lee of the island, as documented by aerial photographs and satellite imagery, appears to equal that of the wake behind a flat plate in a two-dimensional flow at a Reynolds number of about 10. However, current metering, drogues measurements, and temperature mapping indicate internal wake velocities much greater than would be consistent with such a simple low Reynolds number model. Further, estimates of the turbulent eddy coefficient suggest an effective Reyn- olds number more in the vicinity of 10 3 . To reconcile these observational differences and to explain the observed upwelling in the core of the wake, an Ekman pumping model is proposed. It is postulated that the Ekman benthic boundary layer driven by rotation in the wake allows the vertical vorticity introduced into the water at the tip of the island at the point of separation, to be negated by the vorticity of opposite sign introduced at the bottom. Further, it is shown that a large fraction of the kinetic energy of the upstream flow facing the island is used to drive the wake eddies, leading to the conclusions that the trapping of water in the lee of islands greatly increases head losses on continental shelves with numerous islands, coral reefs, and rock outcrops},

abstract = {Seamounts are active or extinct undersea volcanoes with heights exceeding similar to 100 m. They represent a small but significant fraction of the volcanic extrusive budget for oceanic seafloor and their distribution gives information about spatial and temporal variations in intraplate volcanic activity. In addition, they sustain important ecological communities, determine habitats for fish, and act as obstacles to Currents, thus enhancing tidal energy dissipation and ocean mixing. Mapping the complete global distribution will help constrain models of seamount formation as well as aid in understanding marine habitats and deep ocean circulation. Two approaches have been used to map the global seamount distribution. Depth soundings from single- and multibeam echosounders can provide the most detailed maps with up to 200-m horizontal resolution. However, soundings from the {\textgreater} 5000 publicly available cruises sample only a small fraction of the ocean floor. Satellite altimetry can detect seamounts taller than similar to 1.5 km, and. studies using altimetry have produced seamount catalogues holding almost 13,000 seamounts. Based on the size-frequency relationship for larger seamounts, we predict over 100,000 seamounts {\textgreater} 1 km in height remain uncharted, and speculatively 25 million {\textgreater} 100 m in height. Future altimetry missions could improve on resolution and significantly decrease noise levels, allowing for an even larger number of intermediate (1-1.5-km height) seamounts to be detected. Recent retracking of the radar altimeter waveforms to improve the accuracy of the gravity field has resulted in a twofold increase in resolution. Thus, improved analyses of existing altimetry with better calibration from multibeam bathymetry could also increase census estimates.},

abstract = {AbstractThe California Undercurrent (CUC) flows poleward mostly along the continental slope. It develops a narrow strip of large negative vertical vorticity through the turbulent boundary layer and bottom stress. In several downstream locations, the current separates, aided by topographic curvature and flow inertia, in particular near Point Sur Ridge, south of Monterey Bay. When this happens the high-vorticity strip undergoes rapid instability that appears to be mesoscale in “eddy-resolving” simulations but is substantially submesoscale with a finer computational grid. The negative relative vorticity in the CUC is larger than the background rotation f, and Ertel potential vorticity is negative. This instigates ageostrophic centrifugal instability. The submesoscale turbulence is partly unbalanced, has elevated local dissipation and mixing, and leads to dilution of the extreme vorticity values. Farther downstream, the submesoscale activity abates, and the remaining eddy motions exhibit an upscale organizati...},

abstract = {Many large-scale simulations of internal waves are computed with ocean models solving the primitive (hydrostatic) equations. Under certain circumstances, however, internal waves can represent a dynamical balance between nonlinearity and nonhydrostasy (dispersion), and thus may require computationally expensive nonhydrostatic simulations to be well-resolved. Most discretizations of the primitive equations are second-order accurate, inducing numerical dispersion generated from odd-order terms in the truncation error (3rd-order derivatives and higher). This numerical dispersion mimics physical dispersion due to nonhydrostasy. In this paper, we determine the numerical dispersion coefficient associated with common discretizations of the primitive equations. We compare this coefficient to the physical dispersion coefficient from the Boussinesq equations or KdV equation. The results show that, to lowest order, the ratio of numerical to physical dispersion is $\Gamma$=K$\lambda$2, where K is an O(1) constant dependent on the discretization of the governing equations and $\lambda$ is the grid leptic ratio, $\lambda$≡$\Delta$x/h1, where $\Delta$x is the horizontal grid spacing and h1 is the depth of the internal interface. In addition to deriving this relationship, we verify that it indeed holds in a nonhydrostatic ocean model (SUNTANS). To ensure relative dominance of physical over numerical effects, simulations require $\Gamma$≪1. Based on this condition, the horizontal grid spacing required for proper resolution of nonhydrostatic effects is $\lambda${\textless}O(1) or $\Delta$x{\textless}h1. When this condition is not satisfied, numerical dispersion overwhelms physical dispersion, and modeled internal waves exist with a dynamical balance between nonlinearity and numerical dispersion. Satisfaction of this condition may be a significant additional resolution requirement beyond the current state-of-the-art in ocean modeling. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {We present the results of three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic simulations of internal tides and waves in the South China Sea (SCS) using the SUNTANS model. Model results accurately predict the observed wave arrival times at two mooring locations in the SCS. Internal wave amplitudes are underpredicted which causes underprediction of internal wave speeds due to a lack of amplitude dispersion. We show that the well-known A and B waves arise from the steepening of semidiurnal internal tides that are generated due to strong barotropic flow over ridges in the Luzon Strait. A wave generation is stronger in the southern portion of the Luzon Strait because diurnal internal tidal beams augment the amplitude of the semidiurnal A waves. B wave generation is stronger in the northern portion where the distance between the eastern and western ridges is approximately equal to one internal tidal wavelength and leads to semidiurnal internal tidal resonance. The orientation of the ridges produces large A waves that propagate into the northern portion of the western SCS basin and stronger B waves that propagate into the southern portion. When traced back in time along linear characteristics, A waves consistently line up close to peak ebb (eastward) barotropic currents, while B waves consistently line up with peak flood (westward) barotropic currents. This reinforces the notion that the lee wave mechanism and associated hydraulic or nonlinear effects are weak, as demonstrated by a simple linear model relating the amplitude of the simulated waves to the excursion parameter at the ridges.},

abstract = {The ?-method is a popular semi-implicit finite-difference method for simulating free-surface flows. Problem stiffness, arising because of the presence of both fast and slow timescale processes, is easily han- dled by the ?-method. In most ocean, coastal, and estuary modeling applications, stiffness is caused by fast surface gravity wave timescales imposed on slower timescales of baroclinic variability. The method is well known to be unconditionally stable for shallow water (hydrostatic) models when 1 2 6 ? 6 1,where ? is the implicitness parameter. In this paper, we demonstrate that the method is also unconditionally stable for nonhydrostatic models, when 1 2 6 ? 6 1 for both pressure projection and pressure correction methods. However, the methods result in artificial damping of the barotropic mode. In addition to investigating stability, we also estimate the form of artificial damping induced by both the free surface and nonhydro- static pressure solution methods. Finally, this analysis may be used to estimate the damping or growth associated with a particular wavenumber and the overall order of accuracy of the discretization.},

abstract = {This study reports on observations of turbulent dissipation and internal wave-scale flow properties in a standing meander of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) north of the Kerguelen Plateau. The au- thors characterize the intensity and spatial distribution of the observed turbulent dissipation and the derived turbulent mixing, and consider underpinning mechanisms in the context of the internal wave field and the processes governing the waves' generation and evolution. The turbulent dissipation rate and the derived diapycnal diffusivity are highly variable with systematic depth dependence. The dissipation rate is generally enhanced in the upper 1000–1500 mof the water column, and both the dissipation rate and diapycnal diffusivity are enhanced in some places near the seafloor, com- monly in regions of rough topography and in the vicinity of strong bottom flows associated with theACCjets. Turbulent dissipation is high in regions where internal wave energy is high, consistent with the idea that interior dissipation is related to a breaking internal wave field. Elevated turbulence occurs in association with downward-propagating near-inertial waves within 1–2 km of the surface, as well as with upward-propagating, relatively high-frequency waves within 1–2 km of the seafloor. While an interpretation of these near-bottom waves as lee waves generated byACCjets flowing over small-scale topographic roughness is supported by the qualitative match between the spatial patterns in predicted lee wave radiation and observed near-bottom dissipation, the observed dissipation is found to be only a small percentage of the energy flux predicted by theory. The mismatch suggests an alternative fate to local dissipation for a significant fraction of the radiated energy},

abstract = {A patch of sulfur hexafluoride was released in May 1992 in the eastern North Atlantic on an isopycnal surface near 300 m depth and was surveyed over a period of 30 months as it dispersed across and along isopycnal surfaces. The diapycnal eddy diffusivity K estimated for the first 6 months was 0.12 + 0.02 cmZ/s, while for the subsequent 24 months it was 0.17 + 0.02 cm2/s. The vertical tracer distribution remained very close to Gaussian for the full 30 months, as the root mean square (rms) dispersion grew from 5 to 50 m. Lateral dispersion was measured on several scales. The growth of the rms width of the tracer streaks from less than 100 m to approximately 300 m within 2 weeks implies an isopycnal diffusivity of 0.07 m2/s at scales of 0.1 to i km, larger than expected from the interaction between vertical shear of the internal waves and diapycnal mixing. Teasing of the overall patch, initially about 25 km across, into streaks with an overall length of 1800 km within 6 months supports predictions of exponential growth by the mesoscale strain field at a rate of 3 + 0.5 x 10 -7 s -1. The rms width of these streaks, estimated as 3 km and maintained in the face of the streak growth, indicates an isopycnal diffusivity of 2 m2/s at scales of i to 10 km, much greater than expected from internal wave shear dispersion. The patch was painted in, albeit streakily, by 12 months, confirming expectations from analytical and numerical models. Homogenization of the patch continued during the subsequent 18 months, while the patch continued to spread with an effective isopycnal eddy diffusivity on the order of 1000 m2/s, acting at scales of 30 to 300 km. 1.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of turbulent dissipation rates and internal wavefield characteristics is analyzed across two contrasting regimes of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), using microstructure and finestructure data collected as part of the Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES). Mid-depth turbulent dissipation rates are found to increase from $\backslash$nO(1×10−10Wkg −1) in the Southeast Pacific to $\backslash$nO(1×10−9Wkg −1) in the Scotia Sea, typically reaching $\backslash$n3×10−9Wkg −1 within a kilometer of the seabed. Enhanced levels of turbulent mixing are associated with strong near-bottom flows, rough topography, and regions where the internal wavefield is found to have enhanced energy, a less-inertial frequency content and a dominance of upward propagating energy. These results strongly suggest that bottom-generated internal waves play a major role in determining the spatial distribution of turbulent dissipation in the ACC. The energy flux associated with the bottom internal wave generation process is calculated using wave radiation theory, and found to vary between 0.8 mW m−2 in the Southeast Pacific and 14 mW m−2 in the Scotia Sea. Typically, 10{\%}–30{\%} of this energy is found to dissipate within 1 km of the seabed. Comparison between turbulent dissipation rates inferred from finestructure parameterizations and microstructure-derived estimates suggests a significant departure from wave-wave interaction physics in the near-field of wave generation sites.},

abstract = {A comparison of three common formulations for calculating the available potential energy (APE) in in- ternal wave fields is presented. The formulations are the perturbation APE (APE1), the exact local APE (APE2), and its approximation for linear stratification (APE3). The relationship among these formulations is illustrated through a graphical interpretation and a derivation of the energy conservation laws. Numerical simulations are carried out to quantitatively assess the performance of each APE formulation under the influence of different nonlinear and nonhydrostatic effects. The results show that APE2 is the most attractive in evaluating the local APE, especially for nonlinear internal waves, since use ofAPE2 introduces the smallest errors when computing the energy conservation laws. Larger errors arise when using APE1 because of the large disparity in magnitude between the kinetic energy and APE1. It is shown that the disparity in the tendency of APE1 is compensated by a large flux arising from the reference pressure and density fields. Because the tendency of the kinetic energy is close to that of APE3, computational errors arise when using APE3 only in the presence of nonlinear stratification, and these errors increase for stronger flow nonlinearity.},

However, away from shallow, coastal regions the tidal velocities are small, and the work done by the bottom boundary layer can account for only weak levels of dissipation. In the deep ocean, the energy flux carried by internal waves generated over rough topography dominates the energy transfer away from barotropic flow. A parameterization for the internal wave drag over rough topography is included as a dissipative mechanism in a model for the barotropic tides. Model results suggest that the inclusion of this dissipation mechanism improves hydro-dynamical models of the ocean tide. It also substantially increases the amount of modeled tidal dissipation in the deep ocean, bringing dissipation levels there into agreement with recent estimates from TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry data.},

abstract = {Systematic westerly biases in the northern hemisphere wintertime flow of the Meteorological Office 15-layer operational model and 11-layer general circulation model are described. Evidence that the failure to parametrize subgrid-scale orographic gravity wave drag may account for such biases is presented. This evidence is taken from aircraft studies, surface pressure drag measurements, and studies of the zonally averaged momentum budget. A parametrization scheme is described in which the surface stress is proportional to the near-surface wind speed and static stability, and to the variance of subgrid-scale orography. The stress is absorbed in the vertical by considering the influence of such gravity wave activity on static stability and vertical wind shear. A Richardson-number-dependent wave breaking formulation is devised, and the vertical stress profile determined by a saturation hypothesis whereby the breaking waves are maintained at marginal stability. It is shown that wave breaking preferentially occurs in the boundary layer and in the lower stratosphere. Results from a simple zonally symmetric model show how the adjustment to thermal wind balance with a wave drag in the stratosphere, warms polar regions by adiabatic descent, and decelerates the mean westerlies in the troposphere. The influence of the parametrization scheme on integrations of the 11-layer model is described, and found to be generally beneficial. In a discussion of the reasons why this problem has only recently emerged, it is suggested that the satisfactory northern hemisphere winter circulations of previous, coarser general circulation models were due to a compensation implied by underestimating both the surface drag, and the horizontal flux of momentum by explicitly resolved large-scale eddies.},

While this parameterization dynamically accounts for internal-tide generation, the vertical distribution of the resultant mixing is ad hoc, prescribing energy dissipation to decay exponentially above the ocean bottom with a fixed length scale. Recently, Polzin (2009) formulated a dynamically based parameterization, in which the vertical profile of dissipation decays algebraically with a varying decay scale, accounting for variable stratification using WKB stretching. We compare two simulations using the St Laurent and Polzin formulations in the CM2G ocean-ice-atmosphere coupled model, with the same formulation for internal-tide energy input.

Historically, the focus of research has been on the North Atlantic Basin, a primary site where water sinks from the surface to depth, triggered by loss of heat, and therefore buoyancy, to the atmosphere. A key part of the overturning puzzle, however, is the return path from the interior ocean to the surface through upwelling in the Southern Ocean. This return path is largely driven by winds. It has become clear over the past few years that the importance of Southern Ocean upwelling for our understanding of climate rivals that of North Atlantic downwelling, because it controls the rate at which ocean reservoirs of heat and carbon communicate with the surface.},

abstract = {Internal gravity waves, the subsurface analogue of the familiar surface gravity waves that break on beaches, are ubiquitous in the ocean. Because of their strong vertical and horizontal currents, and the turbulent mixing caused by their breaking, they affect a panoply of ocean processes, such as the supply of nutrients for photosynthesis, sediment and pollutant transport and acoustic transmission; they also pose hazards for man-made structures in the ocean. Generated primarily by the wind and the tides, internal waves can travel thousands of kilometres from their sources before breaking, making it challenging to observe them and to include them in numerical climate models, which are sensitive to their effects. For over a decade, studies have targeted the South China Sea, where the oceans' most powerful known internal waves are generated in the Luzon Strait and steepen dramatically as they propagate west. Confusion has persisted regarding their mechanism of generation, variability and energy budget, however, owing to the lack of in situ data from the Luzon Strait, where extreme flow conditions make measurements difficult. Here we use new observations and numerical models to (1) show that the waves begin as sinusoidal disturbances rather than arising from sharp hydraulic phenomena, (2) reveal the existence of {\textgreater}200-metre-high breaking internal waves in the region of generation that give rise to turbulence levels {\textgreater}10,000 times that in the open ocean, (3) determine that the Kuroshio western boundary current noticeably refracts the internal wave field emanating from the Luzon Strait, and (4) demonstrate a factor-of-two agreement between modelled and observed energy fluxes, which allows us to produce an observationally supported energy budget of the region. Together, these findings give a cradle-to-grave picture of internal waves on a basin scale, which will support further improvements of their representation in numerical climate predictions.},

abstract = {Despite ongoing increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases, the Earth[rsquor]s global average surface air temperature has remained more or less steady since 2001. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this slowdown in surface warming. A key component of the global hiatus that has been identified is cool eastern Pacific sea surface temperature, but it is unclear how the ocean has remained relatively cool there in spite of ongoing increases in radiative forcing. Here we show that a pronounced strengthening in Pacific trade winds over the past two decades[mdash]unprecedented in observations/reanalysis data and not captured by climate models[mdash]is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical Pacific and a substantial slowdown in surface warming through increased subsurface ocean heat uptake. The extra uptake has come about through increased subduction in the Pacific shallow overturning cells, enhancing heat convergence in the equatorial thermocline. At the same time, the accelerated trade winds have increased equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific, lowering sea surface temperature there, which drives further cooling in other regions. The net effect of these anomalous winds is a cooling in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1-0.2 [deg]C, which can account for much of the hiatus in surface warming observed since 2001. This hiatus could persist for much of the present decade if the trade wind trends continue, however rapid warming is expected to resume once the anomalous wind trends abate.},

The sensitivity of the energy flux into lee waves from preindustrial, present, and possible future climate conditions is explored in this study using linear theory. The bottom stratification and geostrophic velocity fields needed for the calculation of the energy flux into lee waves are provided by Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory?s global coupled ocean?ice?atmosphere model, CM2G. The unresolved mesoscale eddy energy is parameterized as a function of the large-scale available potential energy. Simulations using historical and representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios were performed over the 1861?2200 period. The diagnostics herein suggest a decrease of the global energy flux into lee waves on the order of 20{\%} from preindustrial to future climate conditions under the RCP8.5 scenario. In the Southern Ocean, the energy flux into lee waves exhibits a clear annual cycle with maximum values in austral winter. The long-term decrease of the global energy flux into lee waves and the annual cycle of the energy flux in the Southern Ocean are mostly due to changes in bottom velocity.},

The estimate is based on the energy conversion from tidal and geostrophic motions into internal waves combined with a turbulent mixing parameterization. We show that internal wave-driven mixing in the deep ocean can sustain 20–30 Sv of water-mass transformation. One third or more of this transformation is attributed to lee waves generated by geostrophic motions flowing over rough topography, primarily in the Southern Ocean. While these results are uncertain due to many assumptions, poorly constrained parameters and data noise that enter in the calculation, the result that lee wave-driven mixing plays an important role in the abyssal ocean circulation is likely robust. The implication is that lee wave-driven mixing should be represented in ocean and climate models, but currently it is not.},

abstract = {Recent observations from the Hawaiian Ridge indicate episodes of overturning and strong dissipation coupled with the tidal cycle near the top of the ridge. Simulations with realistic topography and stratification suggest that this overturning has its origins in transient internal hydraulic jumps that occur below the shelf break at maximum ebb tide, and then propagate up the slope as internal bores when the flow reverses. A series of numerical simulations explores the parameter space of topographic slope, barotropic velocity, stratification, and forcing frequency to identify the parameter regime in which these internal jumps are possible. Theoretical analysis predicts that the tidally driven jumps may occur when the vertical tidal excursion is large, which is shown to imply steep topographic slopes, such that dh/dxN/$\omega$ {\textgreater} 1. The vertical length scale of the jumps is predicted to depend on the flow speed such that the jump Froude number is of order unity. The numerical results agree with the theoretical predictions, with finite-amplitude internal hydraulic jumps and overturning forming during strong offslope tidal flow over steep slopes. These results suggest that internal hydraulic jumps may be an important mechanism for local tidally generated mixing at tall steep topography.},

Kinetic energy is dissipated at much smaller scales in the turbulent boundary layers and in the ocean interior1, 2, where turbulent mixing controls the transport and storage of tracers such as heat and carbon dioxide3, 4. The primary site of wind power input is the Southern Ocean, where the westerly winds are aligned with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current5. The potential energy created here is converted into a vigorous geostrophic eddy field through baroclinic instabilities. The eddy energy can power mixing in the ocean interior6, 7, 8, but the mechanisms governing energy transfer to the dissipation scale are poorly constrained. Here we present simulations that simultaneously resolve meso- and submeso-scale motions as well as internal waves generated by topography in the Southern Ocean. In our simulations, more than 80{\%} of the wind power input is converted from geostrophic eddies to smaller-scale motions in the abyssal ocean. The conversion is catalysed by rough, small-scale topography. The bulk of the energy is dissipated within the bottom 100 m of the ocean, but about 20{\%} is radiated and dissipated away from topography in the ocean interior, where it can sustain turbulent mixing. We conclude that in the absence of rough topography, the turbulent mixing in the ocean interior would be diminished.},

The dynamics of the Gulf Stream in this region is investigated with a set of realistic, very high-resolution simulations using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The mean path is strongly influenced by the topography and in particular the Charleston Bump. There are significant local pressure anomalies and topographic form stresses exerted by the bump that retard the mean flow and steer the mean current pathway seaward. The topography provides, through bottom pressure torque, the positive input of barotropic vorticity necessary to balance the meridional transport of fluid and close the gyre- scale vorticity balance. The effect of the topography on the development of meanders and eddies is studied by computing energy budgets of the eddies and the mean flow. The baroclinic instability is stabilized by the slope everywhere except past the bump. The flow is barotropically unstable, and kinetic energy is converted from the mean flow to the eddies following the Straits of Florida and at the bump with regions of eddy-to-mean conversion in between. There is eddy growth by Reynolds stress and downstream development of the eddies. Interaction of the flow with the topography acts as an external forcing process to localize these oceanic storm tracks. Associated time-averaged eddy fluxes are essential to maintain and reshape the mean current. The pattern of eddy fluxes is interpreted in terms of eddy life cycle, eddy fluxes being directed downgradient in eddy growth regions and upgradient in eddy decay regions},

This parameterization is explored over a range of parameters and compared to the more traditional ad hoc specification of the vertical diffusivity. Diapycnal mixing in the ocean is thought to be one of the primary controls on the MOC and the PHT by the ocean. When compared to the traditional approach with uniform mixing, the new mixing parameterization has a noticeable impact on the MOC; while the upper limb of the MOC appears to be only weakly impacted by the transition to the new prameterization, the deep MOC is significantly strengthened by the change. The PHT does not appear to be strongly affected by the mixing in the abyssal ocean for reasonable parameter ranges. The transport of ACC through the Drake Passage is related to the amount of mixing in the deep ocean. The new parameterization is found to be energetically consistent with the known constraints on the ocean energy budget.},

abstract = {Density stratification and planetary rotation distinguish three-dimensional island wakes significantly from a classical fluid dynamical flow around an obstacle. A numerical model is used to study the formation and evolution of flow around an idealized island in deep water (i.e., with vertical island sides and surface-intensified stratification and upstream flow), focusing on wake instability, coherent vortex formation, and mesoscale and submesoscale eddy activity. In a baseline experiment with strong vorticity generation at the island, three types of instability are evident: centrifugal, barotropic, and baroclinic. Sensitivities are shown to three nondimensional parameters: the Reynolds number (Re), Rossby number (Ro), and Burger number (Bu). The dependence on Re is similar to the classical wake in its transition to turbulence, but in contrast the island wake contains coherent eddies no matter how large the Re value. When Re is large enough, the shear layer at the island is so narrow that the vertical component of vorticity is larger than the Coriolis frequency in the near wake, leading to centrifugal instability on the anticyclonic side. As Bu decreases the eddy size shrinks from the island breadth to the baroclinic deformation radius, and the eddy generation process shifts from barotropic to baroclinic instability. For small Ro values, the wake dynamics is symmetric with respect to cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. At intermediate Ro and Bu values, the anticyclonic eddies are increasingly more robust than cyclonic ones as Ro/Bu increases, but for large Re and Ro values, centrifugal instability weakens the anticyclonic eddies while cyclonic eddies remain coherent.},

abstract = {The rate of generation of internal gravity waves in the lee of small length scale topography by geostrophic flow in the World Ocean was estimated using linear theory with corrections for finite amplitude topography. Several global data sets were combined for the calculation including an ocean circulation model for the near-bottom geostrophic flow statistics, over 500 abyssal current meter records, historical climatological data for the buoyancy frequency, and two independent estimates of the small scale topographic statistical properties. The first topography estimate was based on an empirically-derived relationship between paleo-spreading rates and abyssal hill roughness, with corrections for sedimentation. The second estimate was based on small-scale ({\textless}100 km) roughness of satellite altimetry-derived gravity field, using upward continuation relationships to derive estimates of abyssal hill roughness at the seafloor at scales less than approximately 20 km. The lee wave generation rate was found to be between 0.34 to 0.49 TW. The Southern Hemisphere produced 92{\%} of the lee wave energy, with the Southern Ocean dominating. Strength of the bottom flow was the most important factor in producing the global pattern of generation rate, except in the Indian Ocean where extremely rough topography produced strong lee wave generation despite only moderate bottom flows. The results imply about one half of the mechanical power input to the ocean general circulation from the extra-equatorial wind stress of the World Ocean results from abyssal lee wave generation. Topographic length scales between 176 m and 2.5 km (horizontal wavelengths between 1 and 16 km) accounted for 90{\%} of the globally integrated generation.},

abstract = {Internal tide driven mixing plays a key role in sustaining the deep ocean stratification and meridional overturning circulation. Internal tides can be generated by topographic horizontal scales ranging from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers. State of the art topographic products barely resolve scales smaller than ∼10 km in the deep ocean. On these scales abyssal hills dominate ocean floor roughness. The impact of abyssal hill roughness on internal-tide generation is evaluated in this study. The conversion of M2 barotropic to baroclinic tidal energy is calculated based on linear wave theory both in real and spectral space using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission SRTM30{\_}PLUS bathymetric product at 1/120° resolution with and without the addition of synthetic abyssal hill roughness. Internal tide generation by abyssal hills integrates to 0.1 TW globally or 0.03 TW when the energy flux is empirically corrected for supercritical slope (i.e., ∼10{\%} of the energy flux due to larger topographic scales resolved in standard products in both cases). The abyssal hill driven energy conversion is dominated by mid-ocean ridges, where abyssal hill roughness is large. Focusing on two regions located over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise, it is shown that regionally linear theory predicts an increase of the energy flux due to abyssal hills of up to 100{\%} or 60{\%} when an empirical correction for supercritical slopes is attempted. Therefore, abyssal hills, unresolved in state of the art topographic products, can have a strong impact on internal tide generation, especially over mid-ocean ridges.},

Attention is primarily directed to the behaviour of the solution in various limiting cases, and to estimating the flux of energy into the internal wave field. In general, waves are generated not only at the fundamental frequency $\omega$0, but also at all of its harmonics. But, for values of $\omega$0/N greater than about one half, the waves of fundamental frequency are dominant. For values of $\omega$0/N, less than about one half, the quasi-static approximation, in which the problem is considered as a slowly-varying version of the classical lee wave problem, is found to provide a viable estimate for the wave field. The general solution is found to compare favourably with the limited available experimental data.},

abstract = {[1] A primitive equation model is used to examine the structure and energetics of M-2 internal tides generated at the Hawaiian Ridge. Recent estimates based on altimeter data suggest that 20 GW of barotropic tidal dissipation occurs at the ridge, with conversion to internal tides believed to be the dominant dissipation mechanism. The model simulates an internal tide that accounts for 9.7 GW of radiated energy away from the ridge in the northeast and southwest directions. The strongest generation occurs at three sites where enhanced barotropic currents flow across elongated topographic features. The depth-integrated baroclinic energy flux and energy densities at these sites are on the order of 10(4) W m(-1) and 10(4) J m(-2), respectively. A modal decomposition indicates that 62{\%} of the outgoing energy flux is accounted for by the first internal mode, 15{\%} is accounted for by the second mode, and less than 5{\%} is accounted for by each subsequent higher mode. The tidal dissipation due to bottom friction along the ridge is estimated to be 0.1 GW. The level of turbulent dissipation near the ridge owing to tidal energy conversion remains to be determined to assess fully the barotropic-baroclinic energy budget.},

Such waves likely play an important role connecting the dissipation of tidal energy to ocean mixing. Here a primitive equation numerical model with realistic stratification, bathymetry, and tidal forcing is used to simulate the generation of these waves in a manner consistent with altimeter sea surface observations. The highest amplitude waves originate at three generation sites located at both the island and seamount portions of the chain. These sites have in common both enhanced flows across ridge-shaped topography and maxima in model calculated body force which couples barotropic and baroclinic motions. The model vertical structure suggests the presence of multiple dynamical modes within 100 km of the ridge and not just the lowest modes that have been detected at the sea surface.},

abstract = {Abstract The alongslope currents flowing over topography of sufficiently length scale, typically less than 10 km, on the continental slopes generate internal lee waves. These carry their momentum predominently toward shallower water, that is up the slope toward and across the shelf break, and onto the continental shelf, at least when, in summer, stratification permits their propagation. Analytical results show that even when the lee waves are generated with a component of their group velocity directed toward deeper water, reflection at the sloping seabed may lead to a turning toward shallower water. A numerical model is used to examine internal wave propagation and to quantify the flux of their momentum across the shelf break. In the conditions consiidered here with f/N?1 and slope angle, $\alpha$ a, near 5 deg, the flux is parameterized by a stress (momentum flux per unit vertical area along the shelf break) per unit length downslope,.$\tau$*, given by $\tau$* = k?0VNh2 cos4(? + ?0), where po is the mean water density, V is the mean alongslope flow over the slope,N is the buoyancy frequency in the vicinity of the shelf break, f is the Coriolis parameter, and h2? and, ? are the mean square amplitude of the topography of wavenumber l, such that VIIN ? 1, and its mean orientation relative to the upslope direction, respectively. The constant ? O is 7 ±2 deg, and the formula is only valid if ? {\textless}60 deg. A value of k of about 9 (±4) ? 10?6 m?2 suggested, with values new 1.3 ? 10 ?5 m ?2? when the topography is dominated by wavelengths less than 47$\pi$VIN, or 5 ? 10 ?6 m ?2? when they exceed 2OVIN. This flux represents a transfer of momentum to the shelf currents in a direction contrary to the current over the slope that generates the internal waves. The magnitude of the flux is usually dominated by conditions near the top of the continental slope. Timescales of about 5 days are associated with this transfer on 5 deg slopes with 10?m high topography when N≈10 ?2 s ?1},

Incident mode-1 energy fluxes of 20 and 2000Wm?1 are used to examine the linear regime and a more realistic situation. Simulations using two- dimensional or infinite ridges compare well with ray tracing methods and illustrate how the size and shape of the topography influence wave scattering. The height affects energy transmission and reflection, while the slope and width determine the conversion of low- mode internal tides into beams or higher modes. Three-dimensional topographic scattering is considered for seamounts, finite-width ridges, and islands. Scattering from finite ridges focuses wave energy directly downstream, while scattering from seamounts produces azimuthal energy dispersion. Scattering to higher wave modes occurs in the lee of near- critical and supercritical seamounts and ridges. Nonlinear interactions transfer energy into the mode-1 M4 internal tide. The Mellor-Yamada level-2.5 submodel parameterizes turbulent mixing. For the near-critical and supercritical ridges with realistic stratification, elevated mixing is found over the leading edge of the topography and along a tidal beam up to the first surface bounce. A transition from a beam structure near the topography to a low- mode structure farther away occurs due to an increased contribution from the mode-1 internal tide as it refracts around the topography and not due to turbulent dissipation. Internal tide scattering at topography leads to a loss of energy to mixing and to a redistribution of energy flux in space, frequency, and mode number.},

abstract = {Analytical estimates of the rate at which energy is extracted from the barotropic tide at topography and converted into internal gravity waves are given. The ocean is idealized as an inviscid, vertically unbounded fluid on the f plane. The gravity waves are treated by linear theory and freely escape to z = infinity. Several topographies are investigated: a sinusoidal ripple, a set of Gaussian bumps, and an ensemble of "random topographies.'' In the third case, topographic profiles are generated by randomly selecting the amplitudes of a Fourier superposition so that the power spectral density is similar to that of submarine topography. The authors' focus is the dependence of the conversion rate (watts per square meter of radiated power) on the amplitude of the topography, h(0), and on a nondimensional parameter epsilon(), defined as the ratio of the slope of an internal tidal ray to the maximum slope of the topography. If epsilon() 1, then Bell's theory indicates that the conversion is proportional to h(0)(2). The results span the interval 0 less than or equal to e() {\textless}1 and show that the enhancement above Bell's prediction is a smoothly and modestly increasing function of {\&}epsilon;() : For {\&}epsilon;() 1, the conversion of sinusoidal topography is 56{\%} greater than Bell's epsilon() {\textless}{\textless}1 estimate, while the enhancement is only 14{\%} greater for a Gaussian bump. With random topography, the enhancement at epsilon() = 0.95 is typically about 6{\%} greater than Bell's formula. The epsilon() 1 approximation is therefore quantitatively accurate over the range 0 {\textless} {\&}epsilon;(){\textless}1, implying that the conversion is roughly proportional to h(0)(2). As epsilon() is increased, the radiated waves develop very small spatial scales that are not present in the underlying topography and, when epsilon() approaches unity, the associated spatial gradients become so steep that overturns must occur even if the tidal amplitude is very weak. The solutions formally become singular at epsilon() = 1, in a breakdown of linear, inviscid theory.},

abstract = {This paper discusses linear generation models for internal tides over large topographic features such as continental slopes, with the objects of making the procedures simpler and more adaptable to oceanic situations than heretofore, providing a unified summary of the mechanics involved, and estimating the global internal tide energy generation at all continental shelf-slope junctions for M2 and S2 frequencies. A 'composite model' involving wave generation on a shallow thermocline as well as on the continuously stratified fluid below is developed, together with a discussion of the approximations required. The simple case of a linear slope is discussed in detail; one conclusion is that linear internal tides generated on a shallow thermocline will be small unless T = hL/L?? {\textless} 2, where hL is the total depth on the continental shelf, 2??L is a representative wavelength (typically 20 to 30 km) and ?? is the slope of the continental slope. Such waves propagating seawards are expected to 'leak' into the deeper stratified water in one or two wavelengths, whilst those propagating shorewards on the shelf may steepen to form undular bores. The composite model has been applied to all relevant regions of coastline, and the five areas with the largest internal tidal energy production are the European northwest shelf, the East and South China seas, the Guiana Basin region, the Australian northwest shelf, and the Gulf of Maine-Grand Banks region. The summed global barotropic to baroclinic tidal energy conversions by this process in the coastal regions are estimated to be 1.45 ?? 1010 J s-1 for M2 and 2.73 ?? 109 J s-1 for S2, on an annual mean basis. ?? 1982.},

abstract = {Internal tide generation is examined for a knife-edge ridge and an abrupt step. The energy flux from a knife-edge ridge with a height much less than the water depth is shown to be twice that from a Witch of Agnesi ridge with the same height but a small slope. In contrast, the energy flux from an abrupt step with an infinitesimal depth change compared to the water depth is the same as from a small slope with the same depth change. For larger topographic heights in both cases, the energy flux from the abrupt topography can significantly exceed that from gentle topography. The energy flux generated at a top-hat ridge and top-hat trench is also calculated. A top-hat ridge generates more energy flux than a knife edge of equivalent height, though the increase is large only for ridges whose height is small compared to the total depth. Additionally, the energy flux produced by a top-hat ridge is found to be rather insensitive to the ridge width. In contrast, the energy flux generated at a top-hat trench is strongly dependent on width. A knife-edge ridge of moderate height has much of its energy flux in mode 1. For a height to depth ratio comparable to that of the Hawaiian Ridge this fraction is 75{\%}, consistent with observations. We also show that energy flux estimates based on representing general topography as a number of independent steps are flawed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {How and where the ocean tides dissipate their energy are longstanding questions that have consequences ranging from the history of the Moon to the mixing of the oceans. Historically, the principal sink of tidal energy has been thought to be bottom friction in shallow seas. There has long been suggestive however, that tidal dissipation also occurs in the open ocean through the scattering by ocean-bottom topography of surface tides into internal waves, but estimates of the magnitude of this possible sink have varied widely. Here we use satellite altimeter data from Topex/Poseidon to map empirically the tidal energy dissipation. We show that approximately 10(exp 12) watts-that is, 1 TW, representing 25-30{\%} of the total dissipation-occurs in the deep ocean, generally near areas of rough topography. Of the estimated 2 TW of mixing energy required to maintain the large-scale thermohaline circulation of the ocean, one-half could therefore be provided by the tides, with the other half coming from action on the surface of the ocean.},

abstract = {Scatterometer data at 25-km resolution are used to investigate the effects of the Hawaiian and Cabo Verde islands on the mean atmospheric flow. A wake of weak winds, flanked by accelerated winds, appears for each major island of both archipelagos. The resulting wind stress curl displays dipole-like structures, with positive values on the northern side and negative values on the southern side of the lee, extending several island diameters downwind. These curl anomalies reach a magnitude of 2 10(-6) Pa(.)m(-1) and correspond to Ekman pumping velocities of 3 m(.)day(-1) for Hawaii and 4 m(.)day(-1) for Cabo Verde. They spin up cyclonic eddies on the north side and anticyclonic eddies on the south side of the lee of each island. The response of the ocean circulation is investigated using a simple Sverdrup balance. Two counter-rotating Sverdrup gyres are spun up west of the island of Hawaii and extend to the western boundary of the Pacific Ocean. They result in an eastward zonal transport confined between 19degrees and 20degreesN. East of 170degreesW, the surface expression of this transport coincides with the Hawaiian Lee Counter Current. Similar gyres are anticipated to form in the Atlantic Ocean, but remain to be observed. These results suggest that strong mesoscale patterns in the wind field occurring in the lee of high-topography features must be resolved to force global ocean circulation models.},

abstract = {Observations of tidally driven flow of stratified water over a sill in Knight Inlet, British Columbia, have revealed a broad variety of different interactions depending upon the degree of stratification and the strength of tidal forcing. The flows are described on the basis of a Froude number dependence relating the barotropic tidal velocity to the long internal wave speed over the sill crest. For flows critical or supercritical with respect to all internal modes, an internal hydraulic jump occurs. However, typical summer conditions result in flow that is subcritical with respect to the lowest mode but supercritical with respect to higher modes; the interaction in this case results in a massive mode 2 lee wave or jump accompanied by instabilities up to 50 m high. Early in the tidal cycle the boundary layer separates from the sill and apparently suppresses lee wave formation, but this effect is inhibited at higher speeds. A further, unexpected finding is the generation of nonlinear mode 1 internal wavetrains upstream of the sill during strong tides. While these waves are similar in appearance to those predicted by Lee and Beardsley (Journal of Geophysical Research, 79, 453-462, 1974), there are important differences in the relative location and timing of their formation. The observations reveal the way in which lee waves and jumps relax as the tidal flow slackens, subsequently evolving into travelling internal bores or surges. The observations are compared with recent laboratory studies. ?? 1980.},

The obstacle is a triangular prism and represents an idealized headland extending from the coast. Numerical experiments are conducted at constant Rossby number Ro = 0.06, varying the Burger number, Bu, and the obstacle slope, ??. Flow regime diagrams in the Bu-?? space are determined. For Bu {\textless} 0.1, vertical movement over the obstacle is enhanced and a fully attached regime with pronounced internal waves is established. For 0.1 ??? Bu {\textless} 1, fluid parcels flow more around the obstacle than over it. Flow separation occurs and small tip eddies start to shed. For Bu ??? 1, tip eddies merge to form larger eddies in the lee of the cape. We find that previous laboratory results cannot be used for gentler slopes, since bottom flow regimes are strongly dependent on ?? when Bu ??? 1. The form drag coefficient exerted by the cape is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the one due to skin friction. It increases with increasing Burger numbers and decreasing slopes. When no separation occurs (low Bu), the increase with decreasing slopes is the result of the mixing associated with hydraulic phenomena. For intermediate and high Bu, form drag coefficients reach larger values as a result of the boundary layer mixing associated with flow separation. We put forth an empirical parametrization of form drag in the Bu-?? space. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The evolution of a submesoscale anticyclonic vortex was observed by high-frequency Doppler radio current meters and satellite radiometers. The vortex formed between two large cyclones to the southwest of Oahu, Hawaii. The radius of the core was 15 km; the azimuthal velocity reached 35 cm s-1; and the surface vorticity remained below -f for 9 days, reaching an extremum of -1.7f. The flow was ageostrophic near the center and around the periphery of the vortex. The initial growth may have been driven by negative wind stress curl in the lee of Oahu. The vortex was prone to inertial, symmetric, and anticyclonic ageostrophic instabilities, but the temporal evolution of radial profiles of vorticity was inconsistent with angular momentum redistribution by inertial instability. A tongue of surface water 0.7C warmer became entrained northward between the vortex and the colder cyclone to the west. As the vortex strengthened, a 0.14 C km-1 front formed along the eastern flank of the tongue. The sea surface temperature gradient remained weaker on the western flank. The flow was anticyclonic (-0.4f ) and divergent (0.1f ) on the warm side of the front but cyclonic (0.6f ) and convergent (-0.2f ) on the cold side. This suggests ageostrophic cross-frontal circulations maintaining alongfront thermal wind balance in the presence of large-scale strain S. Surface divergence d was proportional to vorticity zeta during the 3-day frontogenesis: d=-(S/f )zeta. This is consistent with a semigeostrophic model of a front confined to a surface layer of zero potential vorticity.},

abstract = {Mixing in the abyssal ocean is known to play an important role in controlling the large-scale ocean circulation. In the search for sources of mechanical energy for mixing, internal tides generated by the interaction of the barotropic tide with bottom topography (mode conversion) have been implicated. However, estimates of the rate at which barotropic tidal energy is converted into the internal wave field are quite uncertain. Here, I present analytical and numerical calculations of internal tide generation in a fluid layer of finite depth to better understand the energetics of the wave generation process. Previous theoretical models of wave generation have assumed an upper radiation boundary condition (BC) appropriate for an ocean of infinite depth. But recent observations of internal tides at significant distances from their generation region indicate that this BC is not always valid, and that reflection from the upper surface is important. I show that the presence of an upper free-surface reduces the rate at which energy is fed into the internal wave field (the power) and thus the energy available for mixing. This reduction increases with the horizontal extent of the topography (relative to the wavelength of a mode-1 internal wave). Fully nonhydrostatic, nonlinear numerical calculations are used to both test the theory and to explore more realistic parameters for which linear theories are formally invalid. As bottom topography becomes steeper, linear theory underestimates mode conversion by an increasing amount, although even at critical slope the difference is quite small (O(20{\%})). An important finding of this study is that for certain topographic shapes the power input into the wave field can saturate as the topography becomes supercritical. A comparison of model results with a recent finite amplitude theory suggests that even though finite depth effects may be negligible in the linear regime, they may become important when the topography is of finite amplitude. The results of process studies such as this should lead to improved estimates of mode conversion in the ocean. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Tidal models and satellite altimetry suggest that 1 TW of this energy is converted from the barotropic to internal tides in the deep ocean, predominantly around regions of rough topography such as mid-ocean ridges. A global tidal model is used to compute turbulent energy levels associated with the dissipation of internal tides, and the diapycnal mixing supported by this energy flux is computed using a simple parameterization.The mixing parameterization has been incorporated into a coarse resolution numerical model of the global ocean. This parameterization offers an energetically consistent and practical means of improving the representation of ocean mixing processes in climate models. Novel features of this implementation are that the model explicitly accounts for the tidal energy source for mixing, and that the mixing evolves both spatially and temporally with the model state.

abstract = {Abstract Observations and inverse models suggest that small-scale turbulent mixing is enhanced in the Southern Ocean in regions above rough topography. The enhancement extends O(1) km above the topography, suggesting that mixing is supported by the breaking of gravity waves radiated from the ocean bottom. In this study, it is shown that the observed mixing rates can be sustained by internal waves generated by geostrophic motions flowing over bottom topography. Weakly nonlinear theory is used to describe the internal wave generation and the feedback of the waves on the zonally averaged flow. Vigorous inertial oscillations are driven at the ocean bottom by waves generated at steep topography. The wave radiation and dissipation at equilibrium is therefore the result of both geostrophic flow and inertial oscillations differing substantially from the classical lee-wave problem. The theoretical predictions are tested versus two-dimensional high-resolution numerical simulations with parameters representative of Drake Passage. This work suggests that mixing in Drake Passage can be supported by geostrophic motions impinging on rough topography rather than by barotropic tidal motions, as is commonly assumed.},

abstract = {Abyssal hills, which are pervasive landforms on the seafloor of the Earths oceans, represent a potential tectonic record of the history of midocean ridge spreading. However, the most detailed global maps of the seafloor, derived from the satellite altimetrybased gravity field, cannot be used to deterministically characterize such smallscale ({\textless}10 km) morphology. Nevertheless, the smallscale variability of the gravity field can be related to the statistical properties of abyssal hill morphology using the upward continuation formulation. In this paper, I construct a global prediction of abyssal hill rootmeansquare (rms) heights from the smallscale variability of the altimetric gravity field. The abyssal hillrelated component of the gravity field is derived by first masking distinct features, such as seamounts, midocean ridges, and continental margins, and then applying a newly designed adaptive directional filter algorithm to remove fracture zone/discontinuity fabric. A noise field is derived empirically by correlating the rms variability of the smallscale gravity field to the altimetric noise field in regions of very low relief, and the noise variance is subtracted from the smallscale gravity variance. Suites of synthetically derived, abyssal hill formed gravity fields are generated as a function of water depth, basement rms heights, and sediment thickness and used to predict abyssal hill seafloor rms heights from corrected smallscale gravity rms height. The resulting global prediction of abyssal hill rms heights is validated qualitatively by comparing against expected variations in abyssal hill morphology and quantitatively by comparing against actual measurements of rms heights. Although there is scatter, the prediction appears unbiased.},

The geographical distribution of the energy flux is largest in the Southern Ocean which accounts for half of the total energy flux. The results suggest that the generation of internal lee waves at rough topography is a significant energy sink for the geostrophic flows as well as an important energy source for internal waves and the associated turbulent mixing in the deep ocean.},

abstract = {The global distribution and 54-year time dependence of the energy-flux from the wind to near-inertial motions is computed by driving a slab mixed-layer model with NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis winds, improving upon previous estimates [Alford, 2001; Watanabe and Hibiya, 2002]. The slab model is solved spectrally with frequency-dependent damping. The resulting solutions are more physically sensible than the previous, and more skillful at high latitudes, where the inertial frequency approaches the 4×-daily sampling of the Reanalysis winds. This enables Alford's calculation, whose domain was limited to ±50°, to be extended to the poles. The high-latitude reliability is demonstrated by direct comparison with a high-resolution regional model (REMO) in the NE Atlantic. The total power input, 0.47 TW, has increased by 25{\%} since 1948, paralleling observed increases in extratropical cyclone frequency and intensity. If believable, the trend may have important consequences for modulation of the meridional overturning circulation.},

Most mixing has been attributed to high slopes of the large-scale structures of the deep ocean floor such as seamounts, continental margins, and mid-ocean ridge axes. In this paper, we show the small-scale but ubiquitous abyssal hills and fracture zones dominate the global map of rough topography. Much of this rugged seafloor occurs in the Southern Ocean on the flanks of the Pacific-Antarctic Rise and Southwest Indian Ridge. We present our results as a global map of the mean slope of the ocean floor, and as a global map of the ocean floor above the M-2 critical slope. We compare our results to multibeam and satellite bathymetry data to show that satellite bathymetry is not a valid proxy for multibeam measurements, but edited single-beam sonar data are adequate to provide a global perspective on features with horizontal wavelengths as small as 2 km.},

abstract = {A finite-volume formulation is presented that solves the three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation on an unstructured, staggered, z-level grid, with the goal of simulating nonhydrostatic processes in the coastal ocean with grid resolutions of tens of meters. In particular, the code has been developed to simulate the nonlinear, nonhydrostatic internal wave field in the littoral ocean. The method is based on the formulation developed by Casulli, in that the free-surface and vertical diffusion are semi-implicit, thereby removing stability limitations associated with the surface gravity wave and vertical diffusion terms. The remaining terms in the momentum equations are discretized explicitly with the second-order Adams-Bashforth method, while the pressure-correction method is employed for the nonhydrostatic pressure in order to achieve overall second-order temporal accuracy. Advection of momentum is accomplished with an Eulerian discretization which conserves momentum in cells that do not contain the free surface, and scalar advection is discretized in a way that ensures consistency with continuity, thereby ensuring local and global mass conservation using a velocity field that conserves volume on a local and global basis. The nonhydrostatic pressure field is solved efficiently using a block-Jacobi preconditioner, and while stability is limited by the internal gravity wave speed and vertical advection of momentum, applications requiring relatively small time steps due to accuracy or stability constraints are run efficiently on parallel computers, since the present formulation is written entirely with the message-passing interface (MPI). The ParMETIS libraries are employed in order to achieve a load-balanced parallel partitioning that minimizes interprocessor communication, and the grid is reordered to optimize per-processor performance by limiting cache misses while accessing arrays in memory. Test cases demonstrate the ability of the code to efficiently and accurately compute the nonhydrostatic lock exchange and internal waves in idealized as well as real domains, and we evaluate the parallel efficiency of the code using up to 32 processors. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abyssal hills are the dominant small-scale roughness fabric over much of the ocean floor. Created at mid-ocean ridges by combined volcanic and tectonic processes, they are rafted away by plate spreading and modified through time by mass wasting and sedimentation. Abyssal hills are morphological indicators of spreading rate and direction: they are lineated parallel to the ridge at the time of formation, and their heights and widths are inversely correlated to spreading rate. Knowledge of abyssal hill roughness statistics is important for high-resolution models, including models of internal wave generation and mixing driven by tidal and low-frequency flows over the rough bottom. In this paper we present a prediction of abyssal hill roughness statistical parameters world-wide via relationships for the average statistical properties of abyssal hills as a function of spreading rate and direction, and for the modification to these roughness parameters as a function of sediment thickness. These relationships are constrained by new publicly-available digital maps of paleo-spreading rate and direction, and sediment thickness. We also develop a new method for generating synthetic topography with variable statistical properties over a grid, and present an example of synthetic abyssal hill roughness generated for the North Atlantic on a 1/2-min grid. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The emphasis of research has developed through several stages including: studies of the large-scale steady state, the transient responses in localized areas, the alongshore propagation of wind-induced disturbances, and most recently the evolution of cold filaments extending offshore from the coastal upwelling zone into the open ocean. Frequently associated with such filaments is a strong jet-like current referred to as a "squirt". One interesting area that has been neglected by sea-going oceanographers with modern instrumentation is the Gulf of Tehuantepec. There, large negative temperature anomalies extend several hundred kilometers seaward as a result of offshore, rather than alongshore, winds. By comparison with the size of the typical upwelling-filament temperature and current structure, they might be termed "Supersquirts." Significant chlorophyll anomalies seen in Coastal Zone Color Scanner imagery indicate enhanced primary production in the same region.},

A small number of sites where intense internal wave generation occurs accounts for most of the globally integrated work done on the barotropic tide and dominates sites such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge.

Approximate solutions are computed using the WKB method, which reduce to the previous result for an ocean of infinite depth with constant stratification. The conversion rate for a finite-depth ocean can be substantially smaller than the infinite-ocean prediction when the length scale of the topography is of the same order as the horizontal wavelength of the internal tide.

abstract = {Topex/Poseidon (T/P) altimetry has reopened the problem of how tidal dissipation is to be allocated. There is now general agreement of a M2 dissipation by 2.5 Terawatts (1 TW - 101 w) based on four quite separate astronomic observational programs. Allowing for the bodily tide dissipation of 0.1 TW leaves 2.4 TW for ocean dissipation. The traditional disposal sites since JEFFREYS (1920) have been in the turbulent bottom boundary layer (BBL) of marginal seas, and the modern estimate of about 2.1 TW is in this tradition (but the distribution among the shallow seas has changed radically from time to time). Independent estimates of energy flux into marginal seas are not in good agreement with the BBL estimates. T/P altimetry has contributed to the tidal problem in two important ways. The assimilation of global altimetry into Laplace tidal solutions has led to accurate representations of the global tides, as evidenced by the very close agreement between the astronomic measurements and the computed 2.4 TW working of the Moon on the global ocean. Second, the detection by RAY and MITCHUM (1996) of small surface manifestation of internal tides radiating away from the Hawaiian chain has led to global estimates of 0.2 to 0.4 TW of conversion of surface tides to internal tides. Measurements of ocean microstructure yields 0.2 TW of global dissipation by pelagic turbulence (away from topography). We propose that pelagic turbulence is maintained by topographic scattering of barotropic into baroclinic tidal energy, via internal tides and internal waves. Previous estimates by BAINES (1974); BAINES, (1982) of this conversion along 150,000 km of continental coastlines gave a negligible 0.02 TW; evidently the important conversion takes place along mid-ocean ridges. The maintenance of the abyssal global stratification requires a much larger expenditure of power, 2 TW versus 0.2 TW. This is usually attributed to wind forcing. If tidal power is to play a significant role here, then the BBL estimates need to be reduced. The challenge is to estimate dissipation from the energy flux divergence in the T/P adjusted tidal models, without prior assumptions concerning the dissipation processes.},

Several processes in addition to tidal hydrodynamics and baroclinic circulation processes contribute substantially to the observed variability of currents, water level and salinity. The model was therefore forced with realistic water levels, river discharges, winds, coastal buoyancy currents (due to the Mississippi River plume) and surface heat fluxes. Quantitative metrics were used to evaluate model performance against observations and both spatial and temporal variability in tidal and sub-tidal hydrodynamics were generally well represented by the model. Three different unstructured meshes were tested, a triangular mesh that under-resolved the shipping channel, a triangular mesh that resolved it, and a mixed quadrilateral-triangular grid with approximately equivalent resolution. It is shown that salinity and sub-tidal velocity are better predicted when the important topographic features, such as the shipping channel, are resolved. It was necessary to increase the seabed drag roughness in the mixed quadrilateral-triangular grid simulation to attain similar performance to the equivalent triangular mesh.},

abstract = {Three years of temperature data along two transects extending to 90 m depth, at Palau, Micronesia, show twice-a-day thermocline vertical displacements of commonly 50-100 m, and on one occasion 270 m. The internal wave occurred at a number of frequencies. There were a number of spectral peaks at diurnal and semi-diurnal frequencies, as well as intermediate and sub-inertial frequencies, less so at the inertial frequency. At Palau the waves generally did not travel around the island because there was no coherence between internal waves on either side of the island. The internal waves at a site 30 km offshore were out-of-phase with those on the island slopes, suggesting that the waves were generated on the island slope and then radiated away. Palau Island was thus a source of internal wave energy for the surrounding ocean. A numerical model suggests that the tidal and low-frequency currents flowing around the island form internal waves with maximum wave amplitude on the island slope and that these waves radiate away from the island. The model also suggests that the headland at the southern tip of Palau prevents the internal waves to rotate around the island. The large temperature fluctuations (commonly daily fluctuations ???10??C, peaking at 20??C) appear responsible for generating a thermal stress responsible for a biologically depauperate biological community on the island slopes at depths between 60 and 120 m depth. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary motivation for the model is the proper treatment of nonhydrostatic dispersion and the formation of nonlinear internal solitary waves. The nonhydrostatic, isopycnal-coordinate formulation may be preferable to nonhydrostatic formulations in z- and ??-coordinates because it improves computational efficiency by reducing the number of vertical grid points and eliminates spurious diapycnal mixing and solitary-wave amplitude loss due to numerical diffusion of scalars. The model equations invoke a mild isopycnal-slope approximation to remove small metric terms associated with diffusion and nonhydrostatic pressure from the momentum equations and to reduce the pressure Poisson equation to a symmetric linear system. Avoiding this approximation requires a costlier inversion of a non-symmetric linear system. We demonstrate that the model is capable of simulating nonlinear internal solitary waves for simplified and physically-realistic ocean-scale problems with a reduced number of layers.},

A dominant northwestward-flowing North Equatorial Current prevailed from June to December 2000, with speeds typically 0.1-0.2 m s
                        -1, generating unsteady eddies in the lee of Guam. A number of transient eddies off the tips of the island were apparent, the smallest eddies were at the scale of local topographic features such as headlands and embayments, while other eddies were island size. In addition to eddies off the tips of the island, a large (200 km in diameter) cyclonic oceanic eddy was advected eastward past Guam during the last 2 weeks of August 2000. Centered on Guam for a few days, this eddy formed elsewhere and impinged on the island generating anticlockwise currents around the island of up to 0.5 m s
                        -1. It is suggested that these eddies are sufficiently energetic to return fish and coral eggs and larvae to their natal reefs in Guam, thereby enabling self-seeding of coral reefs in Guam.

abstract = {Observations of turbulent dissipation above rough bathymetry in the abyssal Brazil Basin are presented. Relative to regions with smooth bathymetry, dissipation is markedly enhanced above rough topography of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with levels above bathymetric slopes exceeding levels observed over crests and canyon floors. Furthermore, mixing levels in rough areas are modulated by the spring-neap tidal cycle. Internal waves generated by barotropic tidal flow over topography are the likely mechanism for supplying the energy needed to support the observed turbulent dissipation. A model of the spatial and temporal patterns in the turbulent dissipation rate is used to constrain the diapycnal advection in an inverse calculation for the circulation in an area of rough bathymetry. This inverse model uses both beta-spiral and integrated forms of the advective budgets for heat, mass, and vorticity, and contains sufficient information to resolve the full three-dimensional flow. The inverse model solution reveals the presence of a bouyancy forced circulation driven by mixing in abyssal canyons. On isopycnals above the level of fracture-zone crests near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the flow is westward and fluid is downwelled toward greater density. Along deeper isopycnals, fluid is carried eastward and upwelled in canyons. The divergence of diapycnal mass flux is a significant forcing mechanism for this circulation. These results suggest that mixing in abyssal canyons plays an important role in the circulation of abyssal waters.},

abstract = {Abstract Fine- and micro-structure observations indicate that turbulent mixing is enhanced within O(1) km above rough topography. Enhanced mixing is associated with internal wave breaking and, in many regions of the ocean, has been linked to the breaking and dissipation of internal tides. The generation and dissipation of internal tides are explored in this study using a high-resolution two-dimensional nonhydrostatic numerical model, which explicitly resolves the instabilities leading to wave breaking, configured in an idealized domain with a realistic multiscale topography and flow characteristics. The control simulation, chosen to represent the Brazil Basin region, produces a vertical profile of energy dissipation and temporal characteristics of finescale motions that are consistent with observations. Results suggest that a significant fraction of mixing in the bottom O(1) km of the ocean is sustained by the transfer of energy from the large-scale internal tides to smaller-scale internal waves by nonlinear wave?wave interactions. The time scale of the energy transfer to the smaller scales is estimated to be on the order of a few days. A suite of sensitivity experiments is carried out to examine the dependence of the energy transfer time scale and energy dissipation on topographic roughness, tidal amplitude, and Coriolis frequency parameters. Implications for tidal mixing parameterizations are discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract Observations and inverse models suggest that small-scale turbulent mixing is enhanced in the Southern Ocean in regions above rough topography. The enhancement extends O(1) km above the topography, suggesting that mixing is supported by the breaking of gravity waves radiated from the ocean bottom. In this study, it is shown that the observed mixing rates can be sustained by internal waves generated by geostrophic motions flowing over bottom topography. Weakly nonlinear theory is used to describe the internal wave generation and the feedback of the waves on the zonally averaged flow. Vigorous inertial oscillations are driven at the ocean bottom by waves generated at steep topography. The wave radiation and dissipation at equilibrium is therefore the result of both geostrophic flow and inertial oscillations differing substantially from the classical lee-wave problem. The theoretical predictions are tested versus two-dimensional high-resolution numerical simulations with parameters representative of Drake Passage. This work suggests that mixing in Drake Passage can be supported by geostrophic motions impinging on rough topography rather than by barotropic tidal motions, as is commonly assumed.},

abstract = {A scheme for the representation of subgrid-scale orography (SSO) in numerical weather prediction and climate models is presented. The new scheme arose in part from a desire to represent nonlinear low-level mountain drag effects not currently parametrized. An important feature of the scheme is that it deals explicitly with a low-level flow which is 'blocked', when the effective height of the subgrid-scale orography is sufficiently high. In this new scheme, it is assumed that, for this 'blocked' flow, separation occurs at the mountain flanks, resulting in a form drag. This drag is parametrized on model levels which are intersected by the SSO, and provides a dynamically based replacement for envelope orography. The upper part of the low-level flow goes over the orography and generates gravity waves. At the model resolutions considered (T106 and T213) it is assumed that the length scales characteristic of the SSO are sufficiently small for the Coriolis force to be neglected. The various parameters of the scheme are adjusted using an off-line procedure in which the scheme is used to estimate the mountain drag and the momentum profiles above the Pyrenees; and these estimates are validated with the PYREX data. Forecasts using T106 and T213 resolutions with this new scheme, and with mean orography, show that the forecast mountain drag consistently reproduces the drag measured during PYREX whenever the flow component normal to the ridge is large. Isentropic now diagnostics, further, show that the new scheme has a realistic impact on the flow dynamics, reinforcing the low-level wake observed in mesoscale analyses of the flow. With this new scheme and a mean orography, the ECMWF model outperformed, in forecast skill, a version of the model which had an envelope orography and the old gravity-wave-drag scheme, while no longer suffering any disadvantages of envelope orography. The proposed low-level drag parametrization should also be relevant at model horizontal resolutions much higher than T213.},

abstract = {The impact of parameterized topographic internal lee wave drag on the input and output terms in the total mechanical energy budget of a hybrid coordinate high-resolution global ocean general circulation model forced by winds and air-sea buoyancy fluxes is examined here. Wave drag, which parameterizes the generation of internal lee waves arising from geostrophic flow impinging upon rough topography, is included in the prognostic model, ensuring that abyssal currents and stratification in the model are affected by the wave drag.An inline mechanical (kinetic plus gravitational potential) energy budget including four dissipative terms (parameterized topographic internal lee wave drag, quadratic bottom boundary layer drag, vertical eddy viscosity, and horizontal eddy viscosity) demonstrates that wave drag dissipates less energy in the model than a diagnostic (offline) estimate would suggest, due to reductions in both the abyssal currents and stratification. The equator experiences the largest reduction in energy dissipation associated with wave drag in inline versus offline estimates. Quadratic bottom drag is the energy sink most affected globally by the presence of wave drag in the model; other energy sinks are substantially affected locally, but not in their global integrals. It is suggested that wave drag cannot be mimicked by artificially increasing the quadratic bottom drag because the energy dissipation rates associated with bottom drag are not spatially correlated with those associated with wave drag where the latter are small. Additionally, in contrast to bottom drag, wave drag is a non-local energy sink.All four aforementioned dissipative terms contribute substantially to the total energy dissipation rate of about one terawatt. The partial time derivative of potential energy (non-zero since the isopycnal depths have a long adjustment time), the surface advective fluxes of potential energy, the rate of change of potential energy due to diffusive mass fluxes, and the conversion between internal energy and potential energy also play a non-negligible role in the total mechanical energy budget. Reasons for the {\textless}10{\%} total mechanical energy budget imbalance are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Observational and model estimates of the form drag on Three Tree Point, a headland located in a tidal channel of Puget Sound, Washington, are presented. Subsurface, Three Tree Point is a sloping ridge. Tidal flow over this ridge gives rise to internal lee waves that lead to wave drag and enhanced mixing. At the same time, horizontal flow separation produces a headland eddy that distorts the surface height field in the lee of the point. Two observational methods for estimating the portion of the form drag associated with deformation of the surface height field, referred to here as the "external" form drag, are also introduced. Drogued drifters and ship-mounted acoustic current profiles from different days are used to indirectly map the flood-tide surface height field. Data are derived from a depth shallow enough that baroclinic pressure gradient forcing may be neglected, and yet deep enough that wind stress may also be ignored. This leaves an approximate balance between the acceleration and surface height pressure gradient, permitting, in this case, two independent estimates of the surface height (to within a constant). These fields are used to calculate the external form drag at the headland. Drag estimates from both observational datasets agree well. External form drag decreases offshore of the headland as expected, and is highly dependent on tidal phase, with maximum drag leading peak flood currents by 1-2 h at this location. Form drag is much larger than model estimates of the frictional drag, implying that it is the dominant mechanism extracting energy from the barotropic tide. A kinematic argument is also presented to show why the external form drag should increase in importance relative to the frictional drag as the topographic slope and tidal excursion increase.},

abstract = {Barotropic tidal currents flowing over rough topography may be slowed by two bottom boundary-related processes: tangential stress of the bottom boundary layer, which is generally well represented by a quadratic drag law, and normal stress from bottom pressure, known as form drag. Form drag is rarely estimated from oceanic observations because it is difficult to measure the bottom pressure over a large spatial domain. The "external" and "internal" components of the form drag are associated, respectively, with sea surface and isopycnals deformations. This study presents model and observational estimates of the components of drag for Three Tree Point, a sloping ridge projecting 1 km into Puget Sound, Washington. Internal form drag was integrated from repeat microstructure sections and exceeded the net drag due to bottom friction by a factor of 10-50 during maximum flood. In observations and numerical simulations, form drag was produced by a lee wave, as well as by horizontal flow separation in the model. The external form drag was not measured, but in numerical simulations was found to be comparable to the internal form drag. Form drag appears to be the primary mechanism for extracting energy from the barotropic tide. Turbulent buoyancy flux is strongest near the ridge in both observations and model results.},

@article{Bell1975a,
abstract = {The generation of internal waves by the interaction of deep ocean flows with bottom topography is considered. The interaction of quasi-steady currents with the bottom topography is found to produce an internal wave drag and associated momentum flux of roughly 1/2 dyn/cm2, which is comparable to the average wind stress on the ocean surface. The waves are probably dissipated by critical layer phenomena in the lowest kilometer or so of the ocean, the results being a wave-induced vertical mixing coefficient of order 10 cm2/s in that portion of the water column. The interaction of the barotropic tide with the bottom topography is found to result in a flux of energy of order 1 erg/cm2s into the internal tide, which may represent a nonnegligible sink of the tidal energy. This mechanism appears to be capable of supplying a significant portion of the observed internal wave energy in the ocean. The internal tide is probably dissipated by inherently nonlinear phenomena: spectral transport by weak interactions and, in the upper oceans, strong interactions manifested by localized instabilities resulting in isolated patches of turbulence.},

@article{Kang2012,
abstract = {A detailed energy analysis of the barotropic and baroclinic M2 tides in the Monterey Bay area is performed. The authors first derive a theoretical framework for analyzing internal tide energetics based on the complete form of the barotropic and baroclinic energy equations, which include the full nonlinear and nonhydrostatic energy flux contributions as well as an improved evaluation of the available potential energy. This approach is implemented in the Stanford Unstructured Nonhydrostatic Terrain-Following Adaptive Navier–Stokes Simulator (SUNTANS). Results from three-dimensional, high-resolution SUNTANS simulations are analyzed to estimate the tidal energy partitioning among generation, radiation, and dissipation. A 200 km × 230 km domain including all typical topographic features in this region is used to represent the Monterey Bay area. Of the 152-MW energy lost from the barotropic tide, approximately 133 MW (88{\%}) is converted into baroclinic energy through internal tide generation, and 42{\%} (56 MW) of this baroclinic energy radiates away into the open ocean. The tidal energy partitioning depends greatly on the topographic features. The Davidson Seamount is most efficient at baroclinic energy generation and radiation, whereas the Monterey Submarine Canyon acts as an energy sink. Energy flux contributions from nonlinear and nonhydrostatic effects are also examined. In the Monterey Bay area, the nonlinear and nonhydrostatic contributions are quite small. Moreover, the authors investigate the character of internal tide generation and find that in the Monterey Bay area the generated baroclinic tides are mainly linear and in the form of internal tidal beams. Comparison of the modeled tidal conversion to previous theoretical estimates shows that they are consistent with one another.},

We present and discuss the role of forcing functions (wind stress, surface buoyancy flux) in the dynamical balance of the flow and in the meridional circulation and study their relation to the ACC transport. The physics of form stress at tilted isopycnals and at the ocean bottom are elucidated as central mechanisms in the momentum balance. We explain the failure of the Sverdrup balance in the ACC circulation and highlight the role of geostrophic contours in the balance of vorticity. Emphasis is on the interrelation of the zonal momentum balance and the meridional circulation, the importance of diapycnal mixing and eddy processes. Finally, new model concepts are described: a model of the ACC transport dependence on wind stress and buoyancy flux, based on linear wave theory; and a model of the meridional overturning and the mean density structure of the Southern Ocean, based on zonally averaged dynamics and thermodynamics with eddy parametrization.},

abstract = {The impact of topographic internal lee wave drag (wave drag hereafter) on several aspects of the low-frequency circulation in a high-resolution global ocean model forced by winds and air-sea buoyancy fluxes is examined here. The HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) is run at two different horizontal resolutions (one nominally 1/12?? and the other 1/25??). Wave drag, which parameterizes both topographic blocking and the generation of lee waves arising from geostrophic flow impinging upon rough topography, is inserted into the simulations as they run. The parameterization used here affects the momentum equations and hence the structure of eddy kinetic energy. Lee waves also have implications for diapycnal mixing in the ocean, though the parameterization does not directly modify the density. Total near-bottom energy dissipation due to wave drag and quadratic bottom boundary layer drag is nearly doubled, and the energy dissipation due to quadratic bottom drag is reduced by about a factor of two, in simulations with an inserted wave drag compared to simulations having only quadratic bottom drag. With the insertion of wave drag, the kinetic energy is reduced in the abyss and in a three-dimensional global integral. Deflection by partial topographic blocking is inferred to be one reason why the near-bottom kinetic energy can increase in locations where there is little change in dissipation by quadratic bottom drag. Despite large changes seen in the abyss, the changes that occur near the sea surface are relatively small upon insertion of wave drag into the simulations. Both the sea surface height variance and geostrophic surface kinetic energy are reduced on global average by more than twice the seasonal variability in these diagnostics. Alterations in the intensified jet positions brought about by inserting wave drag are not distinguishable from the temporal variability of jet positions. Various statistical measures suggest that applying wave drag only within a fixed distance from the seafloor is not detrimental to the model performance relative to observations. However, the introduction of a novel diagnostic suggests that one way to improve the wave drag parameterization is to allow the vertical deposition of lee wave momentum flux to be spatially heterogeneous.},
