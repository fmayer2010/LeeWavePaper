% This short script plots the nondimensional energy flux over a sine wave
% bottom as computed with a second order accurate in J=Nh/U assymptotic 
% solution to Long's Equation for the perturbation streamlines of a 
% hydrostatic leewave. The computation of E was performed in MAPLE by
% solving for eta to order J^2 accuracey, and then u and w (each to order 
% J^3 accuracy, since derivatives of eta), and then P (to order J^3 
% accuracy, since involves the integral of eta^2), and then multiplying p 
% and w to get E(x,z) (to order J^3 accuracy), and then integrating along 
% the bottom to get E0, which is the energery fluxed from the bottom (per 
% unit length spanwise per wavelength, units of Watts per length) (to J^3
% accuracy).
% E0 is what is plotted here, to 1st, 3rd, and 5th order accuracy. The 5th
% order result is probably not totally correct. But the 3rd order result
% should be.
